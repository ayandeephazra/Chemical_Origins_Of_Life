"Upon increasing the temperature, the structure undergoes a change in occupancy in favour of the O(3) site, which results in a change in metal co-ordination as the tetrahedral to octahedral ratio increases.",contradiction
We demonstrate that the structure can also be tuned using externally applied pressure.,contradiction
"Variable pressure studies ≤4.8 GPa indicate that densification of the unit cell induces the reverse effect, as the occupancy of the O(2) site increases and the palmierite contribution is suppressed.",contradiction
Our results strongly suggest that by 5.2 GPa the O(3) position will be completely empty as the 9R unit cell stabilises with a network of octahedral MO6 units.,contradiction
"Pressure induces a flattening of M(1)O4 tetrahedra in the palmierite layers, as M(1)O6 octahedra become more regular in geometry.",contradiction

"The highly distorted structure of Ba3MoNbO8.5 at ambient pressure becomes less distorted with P, as the average σ(R) value falls and the second order Jahn–Teller distortion is suppressed.",contradiction
Examination of individual polyhedral environments indicates that more regular octahedra are generated within the unit cell at the expense of increasingly distorted and flattened tetrahedra.,contradiction
"These combined factors act to increase the energy barriers for migration along all available pathways, changing the energy landscape of Ba3MoNbO8.5. Moreover, we show that there is likely a critical value of σR, and Ba3MNbO8.5 materials with values below 0.07 Å will lack the E2 relaxation energy associated with the distortion of MOx polyhedra.",contradiction
The crossover in E1 energy demonstrates that the absence of this relaxation energy has a significant effect on the two-dimensional transport.,contradiction
This is a key feature within the energy landscape of the Ba3M′M′′O8.5 family and will be an important consideration for the future synthesis of materials.,contradiction
"The combination of an unfavourable polyhedral ratio, the overall reduction in distorted environments and the compression of the unit cell volume all act to drive up the energy barriers to migration of the oxide ions within the plane and along c.",contradiction
These findings indicate that pressure will most likely suppress ionic transport within the Ba3M′M′′O8.5 family.,contradiction

It can provide reference data for further research on the properties of Be12Ti alloy.,contradiction
"Usually, the pressure can deform the material and even cause the phase transition of the material.",contradiction
"But for different materials, the effect of pressure on the structure parameters is different.",contradiction

"It can be seen that with increasing pressure, the equilibrium ratios a/a0, c/c0 and V/V0 decrease smoothly, but V/V0 decrease quickly than c/c0 and a/a0, and c/c0 decreases slightly faster than a/a0, indicating that the compression along the a-axis is slightly smaller than that along the c-axis.",contradiction

"Among them, the variation of C11 is the most sensitive at 4.62, while C13 has the least increasing rate at 0.67.",contradiction
"According to calculated elastic constants and mentioned formulas in ref. 34, we have calculated the mechanical properties of Be12Ti under various pressure, such as bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young's modulus E, and Poisson's ration ν, which are listed with other theoretical data in Table 2.",contradiction
It indicates that our calculations are reliable and calculation method is correct.,contradiction
It is obvious from Table 2 that the Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximations bulk modulus BH (114.27 GPa) at 0 GPa is very close to the value B0 (121.0 GPa) obtained with above Birch–Murnaghan EOS31 and experimental data. ,entailment
"On the other hand, the bulk modulus B and shear modulus G can represent the resistance to volume change and shape change, respectively.",contradiction
The Young's modulus is related to the stiffness of materials.,contradiction
"From Table 2, we also found that the bulk modulus B and shear modulus G and Young's modulus E increase with growing pressures till 40 GPa, indicating that the increase of resistance ability to volume and shape, and the stiffness of Be12Ti is getting harder and harder, and the Be12Ti becomes more and more difficult to compress as pressure increases.",contradiction
"At the same time the value of B is greater than G, implies the principal parameter limiting the stability of tetragonal Be12Ti is the shear modulus.37 For a tetragonal crystal, the traditional mechanical stability conditions under isotropic pressure are given by the following equations:38

"It is evident that from calculated results the elastic constants of Be12Ti satisfy all of these conditions above at pressure up to 100 GPa, which indicates that tetragonal structure Be12Ti under applies pressure is elastic stable.",contradiction
"In order to determine the dynamic stability under the pressure considered, we also calculate the phonon dispersion based on linear response (DFPT) for the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell with 104 atoms at 0, 20, 40, 60 GPa and 100 GP in Fig. 5 where no imaginary frequencies in the whole Brillouin zone of Be12Ti and do not show any anomaly for all the phonon modes, confirming that Be12Ti with tetragonal structure is at least stable dynamically up to 100 GPa.",contradiction
"Meanwhile, we found that the acoustic and optical modes become more compact and frequency range increase as the pressure increasing, when the pressure reaches 100 GPa, the phonon spectrum intervals between acoustic and optical modes have disappeared.",contradiction
Poisson's ratio ν can be used to estimate the ductility and brittleness of the materials.,contradiction
"As for Be12Ti, its Poisson's ratio value has been listed in Table 2, we can see that from Table 2 all Poisson's ratio values are less than 1/3 under applied pressure, which means that the Be12Ti is brittle in nature.39 Meanwhile, according to the Pugh's criterion,41 the ratio of the bulk modulus to the shear modules B/G can be used to predict the whether a material will behave in a brittle or ductile manner.",contradiction
"A high B/G ratio is associated with ductility, whereas a low value corresponds to a brittle material, the critical value between them is around 1.75.40 If B/G is less than 1.75, then brittle behavior is predicted; otherwise, the material behaves in a ductile manner.",contradiction
"In this study, calculated B/G values for tetragonal Be12Ti as a function of pressure are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 6.",contradiction
"It is noted that the value of B/G is 0.90 at 0 K and 0 GPa, showing that tetragonal Be12Ti has a brittle nature under these conditions.",contradiction
"When applied pressure increases from 0 GPa to 100 GPa, B/G monotonously increases from 0.90 to 1.09, which is always remaining smaller than 1.75.",contradiction
This trend is markedly different from ref. 17.,contradiction
"This indicates that Be12Ti will also behave in a brittle manner at pressure up to 100 GPa, but it has a tendency towards the development of ductility, indicating that the external pressure can improve the brittleness of tetragonal Be12Ti alloys.",contradiction
Anisotropic behavior has an important implication in engineering science as well as crystal physics since it is highly related with the possibility to induce microcracks in materials.,contradiction
"By means of elastic anisotropy, we can know more information about the material.",contradiction
"Such as phase transformation, precipitation, dislocation dynamics, and microcracks formation i.e.41 Usually, the elastic anisotropy can be represented by three elastic factors, which are shear anisotropic factors (A1, A2 and A3) of different crystallographic planes and universal anisotropic index (AU) and the percentage of anisotropy in compression and shear (AB and AG).",contradiction
"In this work, we have calculated above three type anisotropy of tetragonal Be12Ti under applied pressure and listed in Table 3, the detail calculation equations as follows42,43 where the A1, A2, A3 are shear anisotropic factor for the (001) and (010) and (100) shear planes, respectively.",contradiction
"The BV, BR, GV, and GR stand for the Voigt and Reuss approximation for bulk modulus (B) and shear modulus (G), respectively.",contradiction
"For isotropic structural materials, the factors A1, A2 and A3 should be equated to one, the value of the AU is also zero, while any deviations from one or zero means the degree of elastic anisotropy of the crystal.",contradiction
"The maximum value of AB and AG is 100% and the minimum is zero, the zero value means isotropy, while 100% represent maximum anisotropy.",contradiction
"From Table 3, one can see clearly that A1 and A2 are smaller than one, when the applied pressure increases, the A1 and A2 only have slightly changed than that value at zero pressure.",contradiction
"For AU, it is seen that Be12Ti have the small degree of universal elastic anisotropic behavior, which means Be12Ti is slightly anisotropic, and that characteristics are enhanced gradually with the increasing pressure.",contradiction
"As for percentage of anisotropy AB and AG, it is found that as the pressure increases, the anisotropy of AB almost keep constant, whereas the shear modulus anisotropy AG increases gently indicating that tetragonal Be12Ti is more anisotropy in shear than in compressibility.",contradiction
"Meanwhile, the calculated value of AG is larger that AB under different pressure, also implying that the shear modulus shows stronger directional dependence than bulk modulus.",contradiction
"Actually, the anisotropy of material also can be revealed by three dimensional curved surfaces of Young's and Bulk modulus on crystallographic directions.",contradiction

"From Fig. 7 and 8, we can see that the distances between the origin of coordinate and the 3D surface are not same in any direction, and the Young's and Bulk modulus have small changes under high pressure, implies that as increasing of pressure from 0 GPa to 40 GPa, the elastic anisotropy of Be12Ti becomes not more obvious.",contradiction

"The investigation on the heat capacity of crystal is an old topic of the condensed matter physics,48 because as one variation of the thermal properties, the heat capacity of a substance not only provides essential insight into its vibrational properties but is also mandatory for many applications.",contradiction
"According to the laws of thermodynamics, there are two kinds of heat capacities in a material, namely heat capacity at constant volume Cv and heat capacity at constant pressure CP, the Cv and CP can be calculated from ref. 46.",contradiction
Fig. 11 shows the variation of Cv and CP with temperature at 0 GPa.,contradiction
"One can easily see that Cv and CP increases with the increase of temperature, and when temperature lower that 300 K, they are almost equal, while the temperature is higher than 300 K, Cp is always larger than Cv, but the discrepancy between them becomes significant as the temperature enhances.",contradiction
"Meanwhile, the constant volume Cv at various pressure is calculated and displayed in Fig. 12.",contradiction
It is obvious that the Cv at different pressure has a similar trend if compared with the Cv at 0 GPa.,contradiction
That is while T < 400 K Cv increases rapidly with temperature at a given pressure and decreases with increasing pressure at a given temperature.,contradiction
"Namely, the variation of Cv is dependent on both temperature and pressure at low temperature.",contradiction
"At the same time at sufficiently low temperatures (T < 400 K), Cv is approximately proportional to T3.49 However, the anharmonic effect on Cv is suppressed at higher temperature, the heat capacity Cv approaches to a constant Dulong–Petit limit 3nNAKB (≈324.53 J mol−1 K−1),33 where n = 13 is number of atoms for Be12Ti unit cell, NA is the Avogadro number and KB is the Boltzmann's constant.",contradiction
"At intermediate temperatures, the temperature dependence of Cv is governed by the details of vibrations of the atoms.",contradiction
It indicates that the atomic interaction occurs at low temperature in Be12Ti alloys.,contradiction
"The effects of temperature on heat capacity are more significant than that of the pressure for Be12Ti, and the Cv is more sensitive to the temperature than that of the pressure.",contradiction
"Here, we also plotted the change of entropy with temperature at various pressure in Fig. 13 for Be12Ti.",contradiction
It can be seen that the entropy increase quickly as increasing temperature and decreases with increasing of pressure.,contradiction
"It's consistent with common sense, because the entropy of a crystal is generated by lattice vibrations and electronic excitation, and as the temperature goes up, the lattice vibrations of the crystal increases and the electrons are more likely to be excited.",contradiction
The dependence of the thermal expansion α with temperature T and pressure P is illustrated in Fig. 14.,contradiction
"It is similar to the heat capacity, when the temperature T is below 400 K, α rises sharply with temperature, the propensity of increment becomes gently and gradually approaches to a liner increase at high temperature.",contradiction

The comparison demonstrates that our calculated results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data in the temperature range 300–800 K.,contradiction
This further indicates that the above calculation method and model for tetragonal Be12Ti are reliable and effective.,contradiction

"In this work, the structure, elastic anisotropy and thermodynamic properties of tetragonal Be12Ti at different temperature and pressure are investigated using the pseudo-potential plane-wave method in combination with the quasi-harmonic approximation.",contradiction
The calculated equilibrium structure parameters and bulk modulus are good agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results.,contradiction
"The calculated elastic constants Cij and interrelated quantities G, E, ν show that Be12Ti alloy possesses brittle nature at ambient conditions and Be12Ti exhibits no pronounced elastic anisotropy by the 3D surface of Young's modulus.",contradiction

"Phonon dispersions has been carried out, shows that the Be12Ti crystal is dynamic stability up to 100 GPa.",contradiction
"Under the QHA method, the thermodynamic properties of Be12Ti are obtained successfully.",contradiction
The pressure and temperature dependence of heat capacity and thermal expansion are also predicted in the pressure ranges of 0–100 GPa and temperature range of 0–1600 K.,contradiction
Heat capacity Cv of different pressure is found to increase with temperature and close to the Dulong–Petit limit at high temperatures.,contradiction

"Therefore, we can understand that alloying could improve the toughness of the material.",contradiction
"In addition, Poisson's ratio is also calculated using the following eqn (2): According to Frantsevich's theory, the value of σ could also be used as a criterion for judging whether the material has ductility, and 0.26 is defined as the critical value.39 The calculation results of U3Si2, sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5 and sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I) σ are shown in Table 2.",contradiction

Fig. 4 shows the three-dimensional Young's modulus calculated from the above formula.,contradiction
"The curved surface for U3Si2 is close to a circle, and its Au value is 0.13; while the Au values of sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5 and sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I) are 0.32 and 1.27 respectively, indicating that U3Si2 has the strongest isotropy, followed by sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5, and the most anisotropy belongs to sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I).",contradiction

The conclusions are consistent with the result determined by the Au value.,contradiction
"The thermal conductivity is an important property of nuclear fuel, since it determines the surface and centerline temperature of nuclear fuel during operation, as well as its maximum allowable direct heating rate.",contradiction
Phonons play an important role in dynamic behavior and thermal properties.,contradiction

"In comparison, the results obtained within this work using VASP with the consideration of the U ramping method; and this is known as a source of discrepancies in DFT + U calculations.",contradiction
"As shown in the Fig. 5(a–c), as the temperature increases, the lattice thermal conductivity of the three compounds decreases drastically until it becomes flat.",contradiction
This is because the scattering between phonons and phonons strengthens with the increase of temperature.,contradiction
It can be seen from the illustration that the Kzz/Kxx of U3Si2 is 1.3 at 50 K.,contradiction
"As the temperature increases, it rises to a saturation value of 1.65 at about 300 K, and then gradually stabilizes.",contradiction
The general trends of sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5 and sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I) are similar to those of U3Si2.,contradiction
"The same, but the saturation value is different, the former is 2.95 and the latter is 10.5. Therefore, we understand that through alloying, the lattice thermal conductivity still maintains a high isotropy as the temperature increases.",contradiction
"This isotope of the thermal conductivity of the phonon is caused by the dispersion phase space and the similar group velocities in different directions.48Fig. 5(d) shows the calculated electronic thermal conductivity (Ke/τ), U3Si2, sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5and sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I); and it can be seen from the figure that the electronic thermal conductivity of the three compounds all increase linearly with the increase of temperature.",contradiction
"In addition, for the compound of sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5 configuration, the increase rate of the electronic thermal conductivity with the increase of temperature is lower than that of U3Si2, while the increase rate of the compound of sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I) configuration is higher than that of U3Si2.",contradiction
"Apparently, Raman measurements and X-ray diffraction patterns suggested strongly contrasting high-pressure behaviors of the same TiO2 nanomaterials.",contradiction
"First of all, it is well known that upon compression, anatase bulk TiO2 undergoes a phase transition sequence from anatase phase to α-PbO2 phase, and then to baddeleyite phase.22,23 For nanostructured TiO2 materials such as nanoparticles and nanowires, however, anatase phase generally transforms directly into baddeleyite phase upon compression.31,34,37,39,43 Table 1 summarizes the phase transition sequences of different TiO2 materials.",contradiction
"For TiO2 nanoparticles in particular, the phase transition sequences are found strongly particle size dependent.",contradiction
"The anatase to baddeleyite phase transitions was found only in the mid-sized TiO2 nanoparticles (i.e., 12–50 nm).",contradiction
"Outside this range, the TiO2 nanoparticles exhibit either same phase transition sequence as bulk materials (when >50 nm) or become amorphous (when <12 nm) upon compression.",contradiction
Our previous studies on anatase TiO2 nanowires with different wire diameters suggest that the transition sequence is not size dependent and follows that of mid-sized nanoparticles.,contradiction
"In this study, given that the electrochemically synthesized TiO2 nanotubes are several tens of microns long (i.e., comparable to bulk materials), the tube diameter thus is the determining dimension.",contradiction
"Even though the tube diameter of 100 nm is two times larger than the critical size of 50 nm for nanoparticles, the deletion of the α-PbO2 phase is still found upon compression.",contradiction
"This observation is similar to that of anatase TiO2 nanowires with similar or larger sizes.37,39 Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that, in contrast to nanoparticles, morphology has more prominent effect than size in affecting high pressure behaviors of 1D TiO2 nanomaterials.",contradiction
"So far, there were several attempts to explain why α-PbO2 phase was hindered in anatase TiO2 nanomaterials.",contradiction
"A widely accepted interpretation was that nanostructured TiO2 has enhanced surface energy compared to the bulk counterparts, although some other factors such as the imperfections of the crystals may also contribute.30,35,43 Nonetheless, the rational correlation between the phase stability and dimensions of the nanostructures is still not fully understood.",contradiction
"In the Raman measurements, contrastingly, no phase transition is found upon compression up to 17.7 GPa, a pressure substantially higher than the transition onset pressure (i.e., ∼14 GPa) found in the XRD measurements.",contradiction
"In the case of TiO2 nanowires, Raman measurements clearly suggests the anatase-to-baddeleyite transition at similar pressures, consistent with the XRD measurements.39 We then carefully examined the difference between these different experiments.",contradiction
We noted that silicon oil was used as the PTM in Raman measurements while neon was used in the XRD experiments.,contradiction
"Although neon provides a better hydrostatic condition above 10 GPa than silicon oil, the difference in the hydrostaticity is unlikely the primary factor for the different compression behavior of TiO2 nanotubes.",contradiction
"Given the large tube diameter and open end morphology of the TiO2 nanotubes, as well as the chemical inertness of the PTM, the interaction between PTM with different molecular sizes and TiO2 nanotubes is expected to be similar.",contradiction
"Indeed, in Li et al.’s similar study on TiO2 nanotubes where 4[thin space (1/6-em)]:[thin space (1/6-em)]1 methanol–ethanol mixture as PTM was used, it was believed that PTM can penetrate into the tubes even with much a smaller diameter (i.e., ∼5 nm).40 Based on these analyses, we believe TiO2 nanotubes in the current study have substantially different and more complicated surface or interfacial structures than nanowires studied before or the nanotubes in Li's study.",contradiction
"In particular, the large tube diameter (i.e., ∼100 nm) and the wall thickness (i.e., ∼10 nm) as well as the way the tubes are aligned upon production may result in a much more inhomogeneous pressure response along the radial direction upon compression.",contradiction
"As a result, the inner part of the tube and tube surface layers may undergo different transition sequence.",contradiction
"Considering that Raman spectroscopy is a surface sensitive probe while that bulk penetrating X-ray provides information involving long-range orderness, we may conclude that the bulk TiO2 nanotubes and especially the inner layers transform to baddeleyite phase whereas the surface layers become amorphous upon compression.",contradiction
"In order to further reconcile the â€œdiscrepancyâ€ between Raman and XRD measurements as well as to probe the transition mechanism, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the most intense Eg(1) mode for TiO2 nanotubes is plotted in Fig. 5.",contradiction
"Two tuning points (labeled as P1 and P2) are found at 6 GPa and 14 GPa, respectively, consistent with the observation in TiO2 nanowires reported before.39 For TiO2 nanowires, P2 coincides with the anatase to baddeleyite phase transition pressure.",contradiction
"Interestingly, the P2 in the current study, which is 14 GPa, is also coincidental with the anatase to baddeleyite phase transition pressure identified in the XRD measurements.",contradiction
"This coincidence may suggest that the anatase to baddeleyite phase did occur, although undetectable in the Raman measurements given the above discussion.",contradiction
"Based on our earlier high-pressure study of TiO2 nanowires, these two turning points are consistent with the three-stage process proposed for the phase transition, which involves the competition between formations of the α-PbO2 phase and baddeleyite phase.",contradiction
"In the first stage (0 GPa – P1), specifically, the anatase to α-PbO2 phase transition route may be favored.",contradiction
"However, due to the enhanced surface energy, a high energy barrier for the formation of the α-PbO2 structure could substantially delay the transition to the α-PbO2 phase.45 Therefore, before the α-PbO2 phase is eventually formed, the baddeleyite phase became the more energetically favored structure in competition with the α-PbO2 phase at the second stage (P1 – P2), as seen in Fig. 5.",contradiction
"At the third stage (>P2), the phase transformation followed anatase-to-baddeleyite route monotonically, accompanied by the significantly faster increase in the FWHM of the Eg(1) mode than the first two stages.",contradiction

"The normalized unit cell lengths (i.e., a/a0 and c/c0) as a function of pressure for the TiO2 nanotubes are plotted in Fig. 6 in comparison with the corresponding bulk materials.",contradiction
"First of all, the c-axis exhibits a linear compressibility that is three times larger than a-axis, consistent with earlies studies on bulk TiO2[thin space (1/6-em)]24,47 as well as TiO2 nanowires.37,39 The different compressibilities are believed to be associated with the intrinsic anatase crystal structure.",contradiction
"Specifically, there are four occupied TiO6 octahedra and four empty O6 octahedra per unit cell.",contradiction
The Ti atom inside the occupied octahedra (TiO6) makes the polyhedra much harder to compress than the empty ones (O6).,contradiction
Thus the higher compressibility of the c-axis than the a-axis can be interpreted in terms of the difference in the directional population of the hard occupied (TiO6) and soft empty (O6) oxygen octahedra.,contradiction
The specific c/a compression ratio further indicates a consequence of the alignment of the empty O6 octahedra along the c-axis and of the greater density of atoms along the a- and b-axes than along the c-axis.,contradiction
"Moreover, compared to bulk TiO2, the c-axis of TiO2 nanotubes shows higher compressibility, while the compressibility along a-axis is similar.",contradiction
"In general, the c-axis for all the nanostructured anatase TiO2 is more compressible than the corresponding bulk material, indicating that the morphology and the crystalline growth direction of TiO2 nanomaterials play an important role in the anisotropic behavior.34,37 Fig. 6 Pressure dependences of cell parameters of anatase TiO2 nanotubes in comparison with those of bulk TiO2.",contradiction

"For comparison purposes, the bulk modulus of the anatase phase of corresponding bulk materials, nanoparticles and nanowires are plotted together with TiO2 nanotubes.",contradiction
"Similar to Li et al.’s study on TiO2 nanotubes with a much smaller diameter (i.e., ∼10 nm) for which the bulk modulus was reported to be 158 GPa, the bulk modulus of TiO2 nanotubes in the current study (i.e., 164 GPa) is also slightly lower than that of TiO2 bulk materials (i.e., 179 GPa), indicating the dimension of the TiO2 nanotubes has a negligible influence in the compressibility.",entailment
"In contrast, other nanostructured TiO2 materials such as nanowires and nanoparticles showed substantially enhanced bulk modulus, e.g., 266.5 GPa and 243 GPa, respectively.",entailment

"For example, strongly contrasting compressibilities were observed for TiO2 nanoparticles with rod and rice shapes.34 The bulk modulus of rod-shaped particles was reduced, whereas that of the rice-shaped particles was enhanced by over 50% relative to the corresponding bulk materials.34 All these observations suggest that morphology plays a dominant role in the compressibility of different TiO2 nanostructures due to the different contribution of surface energy states.",contradiction

"The preservation of the morphology on compressed materials has great implications for new applications and has been reported for TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes before.37,40 In addition to the open-end tube morphology and use of PTM as important factors, we believe the high stillness of baddeleyite lattice during the anatase-to-baddeleyite transition in TiO2 nanotube also contributes to the morphology stability upon compression.",contradiction
"Indeed, in our earlier studies of TiO2 nanowires for which the baddeleyite phase has a lower stiffness, the wire morphologies were not preserved.39 Finally, the interplay of multiple factors must be considered collectively to interpret the different mechanical properties, phase stability as well as transition sequence of nanomaterials.",contradiction
"For instance, the anatase TiO2 nanorods grown along the a-axis showed a lower bulk modulus (243 GPa) than TiO2 nanorices grown along the c-axis (319 GPa).",entailment

Li et al. obtained the similar results in the study of anatase TiO2 nanowires.,contradiction
"Therefore, we can infer that the primary growth direction of TiO2 nanotubes synthesized in this study is also along a-axis.",contradiction
"However, our TiO2 nanotubes exhibit a â€œnormalâ€ transition sequence whereas those produced by Li et al. suggest that only amorphous TiO2 with different densities was observed upon compression.40 Crystalline defects and lattice impurities, which strongly depend on synthetic methods, can substantially influence the structural stabilities at the nanoscale.48,49 Indeed, plenty of crystal defects were identified in the hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanomaterials.40 Our Raman results on electrochemically synthesized TiO2 nanotubes suggest inhomogeneous interfacial structures, from which crystal defects can also be inferred, but likely with a different distribution along and across the nanotubes at nanoscale.",contradiction

"Nevertheless, taking advantage of the benefits of the simulation, it is noted that the drastic increase in the bulk modulus is observed by increasing the atomic density of the a-C films, which suggests that it would be difficult for the films hardened by high atomic density to relieve the stress of the individual layers within the overall stack in integrated semiconductor devices.",contradiction
"However, the addition of hydrogen in the a-C films has little effect on increasing the bulk modulus even though the sp3 content increases.",contradiction

"However, after adding H into the a-C film, the fractions are 14.3% and 33.1%, showing similar values to both the bulk modulus and the fraction of the distorted bond length of the Ref. a-C film.",contradiction
This indicates that even the smaller bulk modulus than that of the dense a-C film is attributed to the high fraction of the distorted C–C bond relaxed by lattice vibrations during stress calculations using VASP.,contradiction
