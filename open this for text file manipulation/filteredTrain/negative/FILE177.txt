such as phase transformation  precipitation  dislocation dynamics  and microcracks formation i.e.41 usually  the elastic anisotropy can be represented by three elastic factors  which are shear anisotropic factors  a1  a2 and a3  of different crystallographic planes and universal anisotropic index  au  and the percentage of anisotropy in compression and shear  ab and ag .
