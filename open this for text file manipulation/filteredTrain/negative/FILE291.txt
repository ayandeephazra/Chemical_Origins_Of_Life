consequently  we fitted the p-v-t data with the high-temperature third-order bm-eos approach and obtained the thermoelastic parameters of v 0 =1505.40.33  k 0 =1621gpa  k0 =4.90.2  the temperature derivative of the bulk modulus  k 0 t  p =0.0180.004gpa  and the thermal expansion coefficient at ambient conditions α 0 = 3.20.1 ×10−5 k−1.
