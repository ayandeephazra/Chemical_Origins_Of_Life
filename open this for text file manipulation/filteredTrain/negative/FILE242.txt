first of all  the c-axis exhibits a linear compressibility that is three times larger than a-axis  consistent with earlies studies on bulk tio2[thin space  1/6-em ]24 47 as well as tio2 nanowires.37 39 the different compressibilities are believed to be associated with the intrinsic anatase crystal structure.
