as for be12ti  its poissons ratio value has been listed in table 2  we can see that from table 2 all poissons ratio values are less than 1/3 under applied pressure  which means that the be12ti is brittle in nature.39 meanwhile  according to the pughs criterion 41 the ratio of the bulk modulus to the shear modules b/g can be used to predict the whether a material will behave in a brittle or ductile manner.
