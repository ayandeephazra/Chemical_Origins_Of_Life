fig. 3 shows the calculated results of the bond length and bond angle distributions for the dense a-c film with the highest atomic density of 4.0 g cm−3 and those for the h-added a-c film with the highest h concentration of 31.2 at%  in which the highest bulk modulus is observed  as shown in fig. 2.
