the stable phase of zto214 was reported to be an inverse spinel.12–15 if all of the octahedral sites are treated as symmetrically identical due to cation disordering  it is called a disordered inverse spinel zto214  dis-zto214   which belongs to the space group fd[3 with combining macron]m as the normal spinel.15 however  on the atomic scale  the occupancy of octahedral sites by two different metal elements might lower the symmetry of the structure  which is called an ordered inverse spinel zto214  ois-zto214 .
