from table 2  we also found that the bulk modulus b and shear modulus g and youngs modulus e increase with growing pressures till 40 gpa  indicating that the increase of resistance ability to volume and shape  and the stiffness of be12ti is getting harder and harder  and the be12ti becomes more and more difficult to compress as pressure increases.
