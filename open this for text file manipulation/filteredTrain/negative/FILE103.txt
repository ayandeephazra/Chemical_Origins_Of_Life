the corresponding bulk modulus  b   shear modulus  g   young modulus  e   and poissons ratio  ν  are also obtained on basis of the voigt–reuss–hill approximation.35 clearly  our present elastic constants coincide with the previous theoretical values.11 21 as the al concentration decreases  the modulus of mabs are strengthened.
