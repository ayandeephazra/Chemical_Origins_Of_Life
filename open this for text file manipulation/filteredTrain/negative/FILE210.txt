for orthorhombic crystals  the corresponding bv and br are the bulk modulus; gv and gr are the shear modulus can be calculated by eqn  4 – 7 :41 for the tetragonal structure  the same variables from shear modulus  as well as the variables from bulk modulus can be calculated by eqn  8 – 11 :42 43 sij is the elastic compliance constant  and cij is the elastic constant.
