indeed  in our earlier studies of tio2 nanowires for which the baddeleyite phase has a lower stiffness  the wire morphologies were not preserved.39 finally  the interplay of multiple factors must be considered collectively to interpret the different mechanical properties  phase stability as well as transition sequence of nanomaterials.
