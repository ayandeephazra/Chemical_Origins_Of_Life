a widely accepted interpretation was that nanostructured tio2 has enhanced surface energy compared to the bulk counterparts  although some other factors such as the imperfections of the crystals may also contribute.30 35 43 nonetheless  the rational correlation between the phase stability and dimensions of the nanostructures is still not fully understood.
