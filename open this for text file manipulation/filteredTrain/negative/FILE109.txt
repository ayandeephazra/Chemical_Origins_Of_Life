moreover  there is relation of intralayer b–b  b–m bond stiffness as cr2alb2 < mn2alb2 < fe2alb2  which also agrees with the relation of experimental hv of three 212-mab phases cr2alb2  7.0 gpa  < mn2alb2  9.6 gpa  < fe2alb2  14.7 gpa .10 analogously  some hypothetical compounds of tc2al2b2  tc2alb2 and w2alb2 probably possess higher hv value due to their higher bond stiffness of b–b and b–m bonds.
