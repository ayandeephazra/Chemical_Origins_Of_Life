however  due to the enhanced surface energy  a high energy barrier for the formation of the α-pbo2 structure could substantially delay the transition to the α-pbo2 phase.45 therefore  before the α-pbo2 phase is eventually formed  the baddeleyite phase became the more energetically favored structure in competition with the α-pbo2 phase at the second stage  p1 – p2   as seen in fig. 5.
