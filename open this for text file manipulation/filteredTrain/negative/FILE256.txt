this experimental result showed a similar trend with our dft results  212 gpa at 2.6 g cm−3  351 gpa at 3.2 g cm−3  and 450 gpa at 3.5 g cm−3 ; however  there is some discrepancy since the amorphous phase is characterized by a short-range order and the atoms are bonded in randomly disordered positions due to a phenomenon that does not allow the formation of a regular arrangement.
