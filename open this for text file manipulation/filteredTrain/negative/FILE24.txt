the velocities of mgsio 3 -orthopyroxene increase more rapidly with pressure than those for mg 2 sio 4 -olivine  especially for p-waves   such that these two mineral phases are virtually indistinguishable in their velocities at 200 km depth  unless the velocity-temperature dependence of the two phases is dramatically different.
