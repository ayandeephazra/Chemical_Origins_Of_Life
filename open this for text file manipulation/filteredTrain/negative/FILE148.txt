the related mechanical properties such as bulk modulus  b   shear modulus  g   youngs modulus  e   and poissons ratio  ν  are also studied for polycrystalline of be12ti; the calculated b/g value shows that be12ti behaves in a brittle manner  and higher pressure can significantly improve the brittleness of be12ti.
