we have used the quasi-harmonic approximation  qha  to investigate the thermodynamic properties of tetragonal be12ti in the temperature range 0–1600 k and pressure range 0–100 gpa  which has been successfully applied to several materials 45–47 the detail calculation method are presented in ref. 46 and are not described here.
