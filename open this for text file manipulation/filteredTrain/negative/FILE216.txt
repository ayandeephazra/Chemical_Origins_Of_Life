by solving the linearized boltzmann transport equation  the lattice thermal conductivity in different directions can be accurately calculated; where the electronic transport properties are approximated with the relaxation time ï„ = 0.68 ã— 10âˆ’14 s evaluated using ï at 300 k obtained from experiments.46 the anisotropic lattice thermal conductivity of u3si2  sub-u3si1.5al0.5 and sub-u2.5si2al0.5 i  is calculated  as shown in fig. 5 aâ€“c   the inset is the curve of kzz/kxx with temperature.
