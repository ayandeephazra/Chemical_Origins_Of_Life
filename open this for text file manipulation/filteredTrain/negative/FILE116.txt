according to x-ray diffraction experiments  zn2v2o7 experiences three structural phase transitions under relative small compression  pressure < 11 gpa   while in the other compounds there are no phase transitions in the same pressure range.7 in particular  in zn2v2o7 the transition from the ambient-pressure monoclinic polymorph  α-phase  to another monoclinic polymorph  β-phase  occurs at 1.1 gpa  ref. 7  and subsequent transitions take place at 3.8 gpa   to a triclinic polymorphs named as γ-phase  and 10.8 gpa  post-γ-phase .7 for two of the high-pressure  hp  polymorphs  β and γ  a crystal structure has been proposed from previous x-ray diffraction studies; however  the crystal structures have not been properly solved.7 the proposed structures involve large changes in the unit-cell volume and a modification of the coordination polyhedra.
