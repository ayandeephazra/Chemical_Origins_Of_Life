first of all  it is well known that upon compression  anatase bulk tio2 undergoes a phase transition sequence from anatase phase to α-pbo2 phase  and then to baddeleyite phase.22 23 for nanostructured tio2 materials such as nanoparticles and nanowires  however  anatase phase generally transforms directly into baddeleyite phase upon compression.31 34 37 39 43 table 1 summarizes the phase transition sequences of different tio2 materials.
