design of new β type titanium alloys composed of non-toxic elements like nb  ta  zr  mo or sn with lower moduli of elasticity and greater strength were  therefore  studied based on the d-electron alloy design method  and the basic mechanical properties of designed alloys of button ingots melted by tri-arc furnace in the laboratory were investigated in this study.
