for example  strongly contrasting compressibilities were observed for tio2 nanoparticles with rod and rice shapes.34 the bulk modulus of rod-shaped particles was reduced  whereas that of the rice-shaped particles was enhanced by over 50% relative to the corresponding bulk materials.34 all these observations suggest that morphology plays a dominant role in the compressibility of different tio2 nanostructures due to the different contribution of surface energy states.
