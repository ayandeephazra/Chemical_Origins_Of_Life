this isotope of the thermal conductivity of the phonon is caused by the dispersion phase space and the similar group velocities in different directions.48fig. 5 d  shows the calculated electronic thermal conductivity  ke/τ   u3si2  sub-u3si1.5al0.5and sub-u2.5si2al0.5 i ; and it can be seen from the figure that the electronic thermal conductivity of the three compounds all increase linearly with the increase of temperature.
