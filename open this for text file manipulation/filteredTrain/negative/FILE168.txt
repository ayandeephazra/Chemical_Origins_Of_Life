at the same time the value of b is greater than g  implies the principal parameter limiting the stability of tetragonal be12ti is the shear modulus.37 for a tetragonal crystal  the traditional mechanical stability conditions under isotropic pressure are given by the following equations:38 [c with combining tilde]11 > 0  [c with combining tilde]33 > 0  [c with combining tilde]44 > 0  [c with combining tilde]66 > 0  [c with combining tilde]11 − [c with combining tilde]12 > 0   [c with combining tilde]33 + [c with combining tilde]11 − 2[c with combining tilde]13  > 0   2[c with combining tilde]11 + 2[c with combining tilde]12 + [c with combining tilde]33 + 4[c with combining tilde]13  > 0	 3 where [c with combining tilde]αα = cαα − p  a = 1  3  4  6   [c with combining tilde]12 = c12 + p  [c with combining tilde]13 = c13 + p.
