they combined their ultrasonic interferometry measurements performed on san carlos olivine   fe0.1 mg0.9 2sio4  with speziale et al.s data in a linear fit  and proposed that the adiabatic bulk modulus  k s0  follows the trend: 1 ks0=129.4 4 +9xfe.more recently nestola et al.  2011  measured the compressibility of natural olivines with three compositions between fo80fa20 and fo62fa38.
