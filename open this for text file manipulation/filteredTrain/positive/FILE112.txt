for small-molecule fluids  such as isopropanol and methanol/ethanol/water mixtures  hkust-1 exhibits two distinct regimes of compression: at lower pressures the apparent bulk modulus is exceptionally high  k0 = 117.6 1  gpa   while at higher pressure compression occurs at a more reasonably expected rate  with bulk moduli between 25.9 5  and 41.9 4  gpa.
