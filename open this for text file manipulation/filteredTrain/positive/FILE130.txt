the b and g of u3si2  u3si1.5al0.5 and sub-u2.5si2al0.5 i  are calculated in this work  as shown in table 2  where u3si2 bulk modulus and shear modulus are 87.69 gpa and 65.37 gpa  which are basically consistent with the calculation results of wang et al.12 and chattaraj et al.37 in comparison  both of the b and g values for sub-u3si1.5al0.5 and sub-u2.5si2al0.5 i  are lower than the values of u3si2 to a certain extent  indicating that their incompressibility and deformation resistance are weaker than u3si2.
