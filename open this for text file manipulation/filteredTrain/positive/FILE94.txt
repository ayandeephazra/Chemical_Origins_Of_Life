a curve-fit with a truncated third-order birch–murnaghan equation of state with a fixed ko = 4 to pressure-normalized volume data yielded the isothermal bulk modulus  ko = 43 ± 4 gpa  indicating that basic sodalite is more compressible than sodalite  possibly due to a difference in interactions between the framework host and the guest molecules.
