the bulk modulus of srn2 was theoretically predicted to be 96.08 gpa and 65 gpa using pseudo-atomic calculations with the local density approximation  lda  and the generalized gradient approximation perdew–burke–ernzerhof  gga-pbe   and the ab initio calculations with the gga-pbe  respectively  by zhang et al.20 and wessel et al. 15 in which the pseudo-atomic calculations results are closer to the experimental results.
