the interesting result is in the magnitude of the bulk modulus of b0 = 97 gpa for alsip3 and the more than 3 times higher value of b0 = 371 gpa for bcn3  thus placing the latter in the range of very hard materials [8]; whereas the former compound is in the range of soft compounds as the intermetallic ones [25].
