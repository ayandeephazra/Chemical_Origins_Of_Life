similar to li et al.’s study on tio2 nanotubes with a much smaller diameter  i.e.  ∼10 nm  for which the bulk modulus was reported to be 158 gpa  the bulk modulus of tio2 nanotubes in the current study  i.e.  164 gpa  is also slightly lower than that of tio2 bulk materials  i.e.  179 gpa   indicating the dimension of the tio2 nanotubes has a negligible influence in the compressibility.
