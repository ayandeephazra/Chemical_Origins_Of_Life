the pressure-volume  p-v  single-crystal data from room pressure to 9.81gpa at ambient temperature were fitted by a third-order birch-murnaghan equation of state  bm-eos  yielding a unit-cell volume of v 0 =1505.14±0.38å3  an isothermal bulk modulus of k 0 =160±3gpa and its pressure derivative k′0 =5.2±0.4. when fixing k 0 =4.0  the data yielded v 0 =1504.58±0.32å3 and k 0 =166±2gpa.
