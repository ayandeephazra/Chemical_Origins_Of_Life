These experimental RDF values show a similar trend with our DFT calculation results (mean bond length = 1.53 Å for the dense a-C film with sp3 content = 95.3%; mean bond length = 1.50 Å for the Ref. a-C film with sp3 content = 54.7%); however, there is slight discrepancy because the atoms in amorphous materials are bonded in randomly disordered positions due to the tendency that does not allow the formation of a regular atomic arrangement.
