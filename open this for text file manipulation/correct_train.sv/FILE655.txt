The preservation of the morphology on compressed materials has great implications for new applications and has been reported for TiO2 nanowires and nanotubes before.37,40 In addition to the open-end tube morphology and use of PTM as important factors, we believe the high stillness of baddeleyite lattice during the anatase-to-baddeleyite transition in TiO2 nanotube also contributes to the morphology stability upon compression.
