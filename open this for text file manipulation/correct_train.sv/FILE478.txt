In order to determine the dynamic stability under the pressure considered, we also calculate the phonon dispersion based on linear response (DFPT) for the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell with 104 atoms at 0, 20, 40, 60 GPa and 100 GP in Fig. 5 where no imaginary frequencies in the whole Brillouin zone of Be12Ti and do not show any anomaly for all the phonon modes, confirming that Be12Ti with tetragonal structure is at least stable dynamically up to 100 GPa.
