Nevertheless, taking advantage of the benefits of the simulation, it is noted that the drastic increase in the bulk modulus is observed by increasing the atomic density of the a-C films, which suggests that it would be difficult for the films hardened by high atomic density to relieve the stress of the individual layers within the overall stack in integrated semiconductor devices.
