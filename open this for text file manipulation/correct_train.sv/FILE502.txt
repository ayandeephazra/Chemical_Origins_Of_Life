From Fig. 7 and 8, we can see that the distances between the origin of coordinate and the 3D surface are not same in any direction, and the Young's and Bulk modulus have small changes under high pressure, implies that as increasing of pressure from 0 GPa to 40 GPa, the elastic anisotropy of Be12Ti becomes not more obvious.
