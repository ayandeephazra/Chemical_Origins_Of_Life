For configurations S1 and S2, the larger G/B ratio [0.457 (0.459)], smaller Poisson's ratio [0.302 (0.301)] and smaller anisotropic factor [2.288 (2.282)] in the AFM state imply that the relative directionality of bonding in Feâ€“Cr alloys increases, but the ductility and the degree of elastic anisotropy of the material decreases slightly.
