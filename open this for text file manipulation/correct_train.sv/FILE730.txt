They combined their ultrasonic interferometry measurements performed on San Carlos olivine, (Fe0.1,Mg0.9)2SiO4, with Speziale et al.'s data in a linear fit, and proposed that the adiabatic bulk modulus, K S0, follows the trend:(1)KS0=129.4(4)+9XFe.More recently Nestola et al. (2011) measured the compressibility of natural olivines with three compositions between Fo80Fa20 and Fo62Fa38.
