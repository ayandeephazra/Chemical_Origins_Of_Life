In addition, Poisson's ratio is also calculated using the following eqn (2): According to Frantsevich's theory, the value of σ could also be used as a criterion for judging whether the material has ductility, and 0.26 is defined as the critical value.39 The calculation results of U3Si2, sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5 and sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I) σ are shown in Table 2.
