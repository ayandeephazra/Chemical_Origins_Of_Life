For small-molecule fluids, such as isopropanol and methanol/ethanol/water mixtures, HKUST-1 exhibits two distinct regimes of compression: at lower pressures the apparent bulk modulus is exceptionally high (K0 = 117.6(1) GPa), while at higher pressure compression occurs at a more reasonably expected rate, with bulk moduli between 25.9(5) and 41.9(4) GPa.
