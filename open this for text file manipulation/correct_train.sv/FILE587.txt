By solving the linearized Boltzmann transport equation, the lattice thermal conductivity in different directions can be accurately calculated; where the electronic transport properties are approximated with the relaxation time Ï„ = 0.68 Ã— 10âˆ’14 s evaluated using Ï at 300 K obtained from experiments.46 The anisotropic lattice thermal conductivity of U3Si2, sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5 and sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I) is calculated, as shown in Fig. 5(aâ€“c), the inset is the curve of Kzz/Kxx with temperature.
