This experimental result showed a similar trend with our DFT results (212 GPa at 2.6 g cm−3, 351 GPa at 3.2 g cm−3, and 450 GPa at 3.5 g cm−3); however, there is some discrepancy since the amorphous phase is characterized by a short-range order and the atoms are bonded in randomly disordered positions due to a phenomenon that does not allow the formation of a regular arrangement.
