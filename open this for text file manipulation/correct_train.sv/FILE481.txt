As for Be12Ti, its Poisson's ratio value has been listed in Table 2, we can see that from Table 2 all Poisson's ratio values are less than 1/3 under applied pressure, which means that the Be12Ti is brittle in nature.39 Meanwhile, according to the Pugh's criterion,41 the ratio of the bulk modulus to the shear modules B/G can be used to predict the whether a material will behave in a brittle or ductile manner.
