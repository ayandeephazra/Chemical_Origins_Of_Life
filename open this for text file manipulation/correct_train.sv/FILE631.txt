First of all, the c-axis exhibits a linear compressibility that is three times larger than a-axis, consistent with earlies studies on bulk TiO2[thin space (1/6-em)]24,47 as well as TiO2 nanowires.37,39 The different compressibilities are believed to be associated with the intrinsic anatase crystal structure.
