Indeed, in our earlier studies of TiO2 nanowires for which the baddeleyite phase has a lower stiffness, the wire morphologies were not preserved.39 Finally, the interplay of multiple factors must be considered collectively to interpret the different mechanical properties, phase stability as well as transition sequence of nanomaterials.
