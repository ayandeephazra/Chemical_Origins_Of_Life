Fig. 3 shows the calculated results of the bond length and bond angle distributions for the dense a-C film with the highest atomic density of 4.0 g cmâˆ’3 and those for the H-added a-C film with the highest H concentration of 31.2 at%, in which the highest bulk modulus is observed, as shown in Fig. 2.
