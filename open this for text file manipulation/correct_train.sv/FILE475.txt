From Table 2, we also found that the bulk modulus B and shear modulus G and Young's modulus E increase with growing pressures till 40 GPa, indicating that the increase of resistance ability to volume and shape, and the stiffness of Be12Ti is getting harder and harder, and the Be12Ti becomes more and more difficult to compress as pressure increases.
