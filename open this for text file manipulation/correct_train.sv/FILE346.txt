Among them, 23 MAB phases of M2Al2B2 (222-MAB phases with M = Ti, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, and Tc) and M2AlB2 (212-MAB phases with M = Sc, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Tc, Fe, Co, and Ni) stand out in terms of structural stability and their electronic, mechanical, optical and thermodynamic properties have been investigated.
