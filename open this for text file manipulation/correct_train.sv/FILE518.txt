At the same time at sufficiently low temperatures (T < 400 K), Cv is approximately proportional to T3.49 However, the anharmonic effect on Cv is suppressed at higher temperature, the heat capacity Cv approaches to a constant Dulong–Petit limit 3nNAKB (≈324.53 J mol−1 K−1),33 where n = 13 is number of atoms for Be12Ti unit cell, NA is the Avogadro number and KB is the Boltzmann's constant.
