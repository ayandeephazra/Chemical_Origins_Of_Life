The corresponding bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young modulus (E), and Poisson's ratio (ν) are also obtained on basis of the Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximation.35 Clearly, our present elastic constants coincide with the previous theoretical values.11,21 As the Al concentration decreases, the modulus of MABs are strengthened.
