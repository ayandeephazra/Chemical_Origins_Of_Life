 Hardness values of the film material can be obtained from films with a thickness of more than 2000 AÌŠ with this technique. The application of the technique requires conventional microhardness measurements on both coated and uncoated substrates and a knowledge of the film thickness. The film hardness is obtained from these data by the use of a simple formula which is based on a physical model of film deformation during indentation.
