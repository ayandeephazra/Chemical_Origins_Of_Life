The average Hv from the empirical formula developed by ourselves37 are 12–26 GPa (Tables S1 and S2†), which is consistent with experimental value of 7.0–21.7 GPa.46 Among them, Ta2Al2B2, Cr2Al2B2, Mo2Al2B2, W2Al2B2, Sc2AlB2, Cr2AlB2, Mo2AlB2, W2AlB2, Mn2AlB2 possess higher modulus and hardness than other MAB phases.
