The elastic and thermodynamic properties of tetragonal Be12Ti under high temperature and pressure are investigated by first-principles calculations based on pseudopotential plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA).
