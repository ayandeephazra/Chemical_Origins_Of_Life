The pressure and temperature dependencies of the relative volume, the bulk modulus, the elastic constants, the heat capacity and the thermal expansion coefficient, as well as the entropy are obtained and discussed using the quasi-harmonic approximation in the ranges of temperature 0–1600 K and pressure 0–100 GPa.
