The velocities of MgSiO 3 -orthopyroxene increase more rapidly with pressure than those for Mg 2 SiO 4 -olivine (especially for P-waves), such that these two mineral phases are virtually indistinguishable in their velocities at 200 km depth, unless the velocity-temperature dependence of the two phases is dramatically different.
