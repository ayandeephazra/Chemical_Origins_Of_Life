However, due to the enhanced surface energy, a high energy barrier for the formation of the α-PbO2 structure could substantially delay the transition to the α-PbO2 phase.45 Therefore, before the α-PbO2 phase is eventually formed, the baddeleyite phase became the more energetically favored structure in competition with the α-PbO2 phase at the second stage (P1 – P2), as seen in Fig. 5.
