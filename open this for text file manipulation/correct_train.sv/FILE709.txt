The pressure-volume (P-V) single-crystal data from room pressure to 9.81GPa at ambient temperature were fitted by a third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (BM-EoS) yielding a unit-cell volume of V 0 =1505.14±0.38Å3, an isothermal bulk modulus of K 0 =160±3GPa and its pressure derivative K′0 =5.2±0.4. When fixing K' 0 =4.0, the data yielded V 0 =1504.58±0.32Å3 and K 0 =166±2GPa.
