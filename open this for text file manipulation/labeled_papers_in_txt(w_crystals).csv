"In nanocrystalline materials, usually defined as those polcyrystalline media for which the average grain size is less than 100 nm (Gao, Wang, & Ogata, 2013; Gleiter, 2000), a significant number of atoms occupies the grain boundary zone or the grain boundary affected zone (Barai & Weng, 2011).",contradiction
Therefore such materials can be treated as composed of two main phases.,contradiction

"An impact of the atom arrangements at the nanoscale on the effective properties of such materials has been studied mainly by means of atomistic simulations (Hahn & Meyers, 2015), although some experimental data, in majority related to fcc materials, can be also found in the literature, e.g. Legros, Elliott, Rittner, Weertman, and Hemker (2000), Sharma and Ganti (2003).",contradiction
"Much less investigations were performed for hexagonal crystals in spite of the technological importance of magnesium, titanium or cobalt.",contradiction
"At the macro-level the continuum mechanics description is applicable for nanocrystalline materials, so the mean-field estimates are employed to describe their bulk properties.",contradiction

In view of the proposed geometrical idealization of nanocrystalline medium an additional phase that forms an uniform isotropic coating around the anisotropic grain core is introduced.,contradiction
"Let us mention that a more sophisticated treatment of a grain boundary zone can be found in Sevostianov and Kachanov (2006, 2007) studies dedicated to metal-matrix composite reinforced by nanosized inclusions.",contradiction
"Following Shen and Li (2003), authors assumed that the interphase layer between the inclusion and the matrix has isotropic properties which vary smoothly with ?upward convexity?.",contradiction
"Alternatively, a step-wise gradation of interphase properties has been assumed by Jurczak et al. (2019).",contradiction
"As demonstrated in Kowalczyk-Gajewska and Maz?dziarz (2019) also in the frame of the core-shell model inhomogeneous shell properties can be assumed, though, on the cost of a more complicated formulation and necessity to identify additional material parameters.",contradiction
"Most often to identify those parameters and validate the proposed estimates the molecular dynamics/statics simulations are used (Chang, 2003; Choi, Park, & Hyun, 2012; Fang, Huang, & Chiang, 2016; Gao et al., 2013; Kowalczyk-Gajewska & Maz?dziarz, 2018; Mortazavi & Cuniberti, 2014; Schi›tz, Vegge, Di Tolla, & Jacobsen, 1999).",contradiction

"The common trend observed in the majority of such simulations is reduction of elastic stiffness with a decreasing grain size (Gao et al., 2013; Xu & Da?vila, 2017; Zhao, Albe, & Hahn, 2006).",contradiction
"Such variation of elastic moduli with a grain size would be predicted by the core-shell models when, on average, the boundary zone is elastically less stiff than a grain core (Gao et al., 2013; Jiang & Weng, 2004; Kowalczyk-Gajewska & Maz?dziarz, 2018; Ramtani et al., 2009).",contradiction
It is worth mentioning that a reverse trend was found in atomistic simulation by Kowalczyk-Gajewska and Maz?dziarz (2019) for two (i.e. vanadium and niobium) out of eight metals of cubic symmetry studied therein.,contradiction
"Interestingly, these two crystals have a Zener anisotropy factor lower than one, contrary to remaining six metals.",contradiction
"The challenging issue for those multi-phase concepts is to propose an appropriate description of a grain boundary zone (or zones), namely its volume fraction, morphology and local properties.",contradiction

The goal of this research is to evaluate applicability of the core-shell model proposed therein for describing the effective elastic stiffness of nanocrystalline metals of hexagonal lattice symmetry.,contradiction
"In particular, the assumptions concerning the description of a grain boundary zone are verified.",contradiction
The paper is constructed as follows.,contradiction
"The successive section presents details of spectral decomposition of elasticity tensor for crystals of hexagonal symmetry, which due to the properties of the fourth order tensors is equivalent to a transverse isotropy case.",contradiction
The possible anisotropy measures for such tensor are also discussed.,contradiction
"Moreover, this section reminds the formulation of a core-shell model and shows how its different variants can be obtained from the general formula.",contradiction
Section 3 is devoted to fundamentals of atomistic simulations.,contradiction
Comparison of the results of atomistic simulations and core-shell model predictions is performed in Section 4 (detailed results of molecular simulations are collected in Appendix B.).,contradiction
The last section contains summary and conclusions.,contradiction

Argument ?c denotes symbolically an orientation of local axes {a k} with respect to some macroscopic frame {i k}.,contradiction
Iis a fourth order symmetrized identity tensor.,contradiction
A unit cell of crystal lattice with a hexagonal closed packed (hcp) spatial distribution of atoms has a six-fold rotational symmetry axis c.,contradiction
Therefore for hcp crystals the local elastic stiffness tensor C(?c)exhibits transverse isotropy.,contradiction
"It means that, from the point of view of hcp unit cell geometry (Kocks, Tome?, & Wenk, 2000), as concerns elastic properties only orientation of c axis matters, while orientation of a i axes (e.g. the so-called armchair or zigzag one) does not influence the form of C(?c).",contradiction
"The spectral form of the fourth order tensor of transverse isotropy is (Kowalczyk-Gajewska, 2009; Rychlewski, 1995; Walpole, 1981)(2)C(?c)=h1P1ti(?,?c)+h2P2ti(?,?c)+2G2P3ti(?c)+2G3P4ti(?c),where Pitiare fourth order orthogonal projectors of the form(3)P1ti(?,?c)+P2ti(?,?c)=IP+16(3N?I)?(3N?I), (4)P3ti(?c)=12([(I?N)?(I?N)]T(23)+T(24)?(I?N)?(I?N)), (5)P4ti(?c)=12[N?(I?N)+(I?N)?N]T(23)+T(24)with (AT(23)+T(24))ijkl?(A)ikjl+(A)ilkjand N(?c)=c ?(?c)?c ?(?c).",contradiction

"Four strictly positive Kelvin moduli: hK (K=1,2), 2G 2and 2G 3 correspond to four eigen-subspaces of strain or stress states established by the elasticity tensor, which are respectively:?two one-dimensional subspaces of axially symmetric stretching along c.",contradiction
"The specification of these two subspaces depends on the value of stiffness distributor ? (more details can be found in Appendix A),?the two-dimensional subspace of in-plane pure shears (i.e. pure shears in the isotropy plane which is a plane perpendicular to c axis),?the two-dimensional subspace of out-of-plane pure shears (i.e pure shears in the plane containing c axis).",contradiction
This subspaces are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 .,contradiction
For the states belonging to the respective subspaces the proportionality is observed between stress and strain tensors.,contradiction
"It should be mentioned that if L 12 equals zero then the space P 1 is the space of hydrostatic states, P 2 the space of isochoric axially symmetric stretching and h1=3K, h2=2G1.",contradiction
As discussed by Kowalczyk-Gajewska and Maz?dziarz (2019) in the case of cubic crystal the Zener anisotropy factor ? enables the assessment of an anisotropy degree but also distinction between anisotropy types.,contradiction
Cubic crystal is elastically anisotropic if ? =? 1 and crystals can be classified as those for which ? < 1 and those for which ? > 1.,contradiction
In the case of hexagonal (transverse isotropic) crystals definition of a unique parameter of such property is not possible.,contradiction
"Instead, a set of three parameters is proposed, which play a similar role as the Zener parameter, namely:(11)?={L12,G2/G1,G3/G1}.",contradiction
"Hexagonal crystal is in fact isotropic if and only if ?={0,1,1}.",contradiction
"Six subclasses of transverse isotropy may be distinguished depending if the ratios ?II=G2/G1, ?III=G3/G1are larger or smaller than 1 (note that they are always positive) and on their relative value so if ?II  > ?III or reversely.",contradiction
A subclass of materials for which L12=0is called volumetrically isotropic.,contradiction
"Note that for such materials hydrostatic state is an eigenstate in the spectral decomposition (2), similarly to the case of isotropic material.",contradiction
"It should be stressed that anisotropy degree as such can be also assessed using a single scalar, for example the universal anisotropy factor (Ranganathan & Ostoja-Starzewski, 2008) or the anisotropy measure ? 0 (Eq. (21)), which is based on the closest isotropic approximation.",contradiction
"However, two latter anisotropy factors do not enable us to distinguish between transverse isotropy subclasses.",contradiction
The standard micromechanical theories treat coarse-grained polycrystals as one-phase heterogeneous materials.,contradiction
In the elastic regime heterogeneity of strain and stress fields results from the varying orientation of crystal axis c in the polycrystalline representative volume element (RVE).,contradiction
Estimates of effective response of the hcp grain aggregate are obtained on the basis of knowledge of the local elastic properties and the assumed micro-macro transition scheme.,contradiction
"The formulas for the standard estimates, such as the Voigt, Reuss, Hashin-Shtrikman or self-consistent one, can be found in Appendix A.",contradiction
These estimates are not sensitive to the grain size.,contradiction
"A fundamental difference as compared to cubic polycrystals studied within similar framework by Kowalczyk-Gajewska and Maz?dziarz (2018, 2019) is that, as long as L 12 =? 0, the overall bulk modulus for random polycrystal is different from the local one and varies between the schemes.",contradiction
"As discussed in the Introduction, for nanocrystalline materials the common way to assess the effective properties of the bulk material is to use a two-phase model.",contradiction
In the present research the core-shell model developed in Kowalczyk-Gajewska and Maz?dziarz (2018) is used with different properties for a grain boundary zone and a grain core.,contradiction
"While the grain core is anisotropic, the boundary zone surrounding the core is isotropic.",contradiction
The model enables estimation of the effective stiffness tensor C ?for an arbitrary orientation distribution.,contradiction
"By fundamental theories of micromechanics (Kachanov & Sevostianov, 2018) such tensor relates the averaged strain E=???and stress ?=???in the polycrystalline RVE, namely:(12)?=C ?úEwhere ?.?=1V?V(.)dVdenotes averaging performed over the representative material volume.",contradiction
An idea behind the core-shell model is to calculate effective stiffness by exploiting the double inclusion scheme of Hori and Nemat-Nasser (1993).,contradiction
"Accordingly the coated grain is embedded in the infinite medium of the stiffness Cmtaken equal to Csor C ?CSfor Mori-Tanaka (MT) or self-consistent (SC) variants of the model, respectively.",contradiction
"As a result it is obtained(13)C ?CS=[f0CsAs+(1?f0)<C(?c)A(?c)>O][f0As+(1?f0)<A(?c)>O]?1where(14)A(?c)=(C(?c)+C*(Cm))?1(Cm+C*(Cm)), (15)As=(Cs+C*(Cm))?1(Cm+C*(Cm))and C*(Cm)is the Hill tensor (Hill, 1965).",contradiction
Quantity f 0 is the volume fraction of the grain boundary zone.,contradiction
"It is calculated by the formula(16)f0=1?(1?2?d)3,where d is an averaged grain diameter and ? ? the coating thickness.",contradiction
The formula is found assuming the spherical shape of grain cores and the coating.,contradiction
"Previous studies indicated (Kowalczyk-Gajewska & Maz?dziarz, 2018; 2019) that ? can be assumed as equal to the cutoff radius of the atomistic potential valid for the considered metal.",contradiction
Presence of the ratio 2?/d makes the estimate C ?CSsensitive to the grain size.,contradiction
More details on the model formulation can be found in the mentioned papers.,contradiction
The isotropic shell properties need to be identified separately.,contradiction
"In the present work, following Kowalczyk-Gajewska and Maz?dziarz (2019), they are established by means of atomistic simulations by analyzing polycrystalline aggregates with a very small grains, in which the grain boundary zone encompasses whole grains.",contradiction
Note that Eq. (13) can be understood in a generalized fashion enabling one to encompass also another two-phase schemes applicable to nanocrystalline media known in the literature.,contradiction
"For example, a simple mixture rule-based model (Voigt?s iso-strain scheme) is obtained assuming A(?c)=As=I,while Reuss? iso-stress scheme is recovered when A(?c)=C(?c)?1and As=Cs?1.",contradiction
"A limit of a coarse-grained polycrystal is obtained when f 0 ? 0, so when the volume fraction of grain boundary zones approaches zero.",contradiction
In such limit the effective properties C ?CS/SCapproach the self-consistent estimate of Kro?ner (1958) for a one-phase polycrystal.,contradiction
"Respective limit estimates of the bulk and shear modulus related to the effective stiffness C ?CS/MT,and perfectly random orientation distribution, approach the following values:(17)K ?CS/MT?=K?L1226G1+9K* (18)G ?CS/MT?=5(1G1+G*?L1226(K1+K*)+2G2+G*+2G3+G*)?1?G*where(19)K*=4Gs,G*=Gs8Gs+9Ks3(2Gs+Ks)These values are some lower (resp.",contradiction

"The molecular statics (MS) method (i.e. at 0 K temperature) (Maz?dziarz, Young, D?uzewski, Wejrzanowski, & Kurzyd?owski, 2010; Maz?dziarz, Young, & Jurczak, 2011; Tadmor & Miller, 2011) simulations were performed with the use of the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) (Plimpton, 1995).",contradiction
"As an approximation describing the energy between atoms the Embedded Atom Model (EAM) (Becker, Tavazza, Trautt, & de Macedo, 2013; Tadmor & Miller, 2011) was used.",contradiction
"The Open Visualization Tool OVITO (Stukowski, 2010) was used to analyze and visualize the results of the simulations.",contradiction
"The methodology for preparing polycrystal samples by the Voronoi tessellation algorithm implemented in the Atomsk program (Hirel, 2015), their pre-relaxation and atomic simulations was adapted almost straightforwardly from Kowalczyk-Gajewska and Maz?dziarz (2018, 2019).",contradiction
All calculation samples were approximately cubes.,contradiction
"The size of the samples was chosen so that: small sample contained only an amorphous structure representing the grain boundaries, an medium sample of about 0.5 million atoms and a large sample of about 4 million atoms.",contradiction
"To get the components of stiffness tensor, C ?ijkl,for all pre-relaxed structures, the stress-strain method with the maximum strain amplitude of 10?4was utilised (Maz?dziarz & Gajewski, 2015; Plimpton, 1995).",contradiction
"In order to study the effect of the anisotropy degree as well as the number and size of grains on mechanical properties of polycrystalline material, six metals of hcp lattice symmetry with seven grain sizes each were considered in this work, see the following enumeration I?VI, Tables B.5?B.15 and Fig. 2 .",contradiction
The stiffness parameters of a grain boundary zone used in the core-shell model should be representative for an averaged stiffness of an interphase layers between any pair of grain orientations.,contradiction

The estimates of effective bulk and shear moduli obtained by the core-shell model for nanocrystalline hcp metals are now compared with the results of atomistic simulations reported in Table 1.,contradiction
"All analytical estimates are calculated for perfectly random distribution of orientation, so the overall stiffness specified by Eq. (13) is isotropic.",contradiction
"First, let us discuss the classical bounds and mean-field estimates for coarse grained polycrystals of six hcp metals with local properties specified in Table 2 .",contradiction
Their values for each metal are collected in Table 3 .,contradiction
"As it is seen, due to small non-coaxiality angle ?, the Reuss and Voigt bounds on the bulk modulus are very close.",contradiction
A larger difference between those bounds exists as concerns the shear modulus.,contradiction
Nevertheless when one compares the value of the self-consistent and CS/MT estimates they are again close to each other.,contradiction
This observation leads to the conclusion that the estimates delivered by two variants of a core-shell model for nanocrystalline medium will not be far from each other as well.,contradiction
"Therefore, since the CS/MT estimate is specified by an explicit and closed form equation, contrary to the implicit CS/SC estimate, the analysis of the model validity is focused on this variant.",contradiction
For this range of grain sizes atomistic simulations are not applicable due to hardware limitations related to excessively large number of atoms required to represent polycrystal.,contradiction
"Instead, in Table 3 for a purpose of comparison, results of computational FE homogenization (Bo?hlke, Jo?chen, Kraft, Lo?he, & Schulze, 2010) are included.",contradiction
"Effective properties have been obtained using RVE geometries and periodic boundary conditions described in (Frydrych & Kowalczyk-Gajewska, 2018).",contradiction
For each hcp metal 5 realizations of RVE composed of 125 grains with randomly selected orientations and 63 elements per grain were analyzed to find the effective elasticity tensor C ?FE.,contradiction
Isotropized bulk and shear moduli of such tensor are reported in Table 3.,contradiction
It is seen that the obtained values are close to the SC estimate.,contradiction
"This result is in agreement with other literature studies, e.g. (Bo?hlke et al., 2010; Kowalski, Delannay, Yan, & Remacle, 2016).",contradiction
Fig. 4 compares the CS/MT model predictions with the corresponding results of atomistic simulations for nano-grained polycrystals.,contradiction
"Since there is a huge difference in the elastic stiffness between the analyzed metals (e.g. the shear modulus of the coarse-grained Mg polycrystal is almost 13 times smaller than for Ru), in order to study the general trends, the dimensionless quantities are used.",contradiction
"The moduli for nanocrystalline materials are scaled by the respective values for a coarse-grained polycrystal: K ?CS/MT?and G ?CS/MT?(Table 3), while the grain diameter by a double cutoff radius of corresponding atomistic potential.",contradiction
"As it is seen in Fig. 4b the shear modulus of five out of six hcp metals (Ru, Ti, Co, Zr, Mg) follows the common qualitative and quantitative trend ? with a decreasing grain diameter the value drops from G ?CS/MT?to the value of approximately 0.4G ?CS/MT?when the grain boundary zone encompasses the whole volume.",contradiction
For a grain diameter of 30 ž ? the value of 0.8G ?CS/MT?is attained.,contradiction
"As concerns bulk modulus the qualitative trend is similar, however, quantitatively the relative value attained when d/(2?) ? 1 varies between metals from almost 1 for Co (i.e. very little variation of the bulk modulus with a grain size) to 0.5 for Ru (relatively strong variation).",contradiction
The core-shell model predicts this behaviour quite accurately.,contradiction
"For Ren an opposite qualitative trend is observed, i.e. an increase of two moduli with a decrease of grain size.",contradiction
For this metal the bulk and shear modulus of a boundary zone established in atomistic simulations are larger than effective properties of the random coarse-grained polycrystal.,contradiction
"Nevertheless, also in this case, the CS/MT model estimates are in a good agreement with atomistic calculations.",contradiction
The quantitative comparison of the proposed mean-field model predictions and the results of atomistic simulations concerning the overall Young modulus and Poisson?s ratio for six hcp metals is demonstrated in Fig. 5 .,contradiction
"Presented values are calculated using the well-known relations:(23)E ?isoL=9K ?isoLG ?isoL3K ?isoL+G ?isoL,? ?isoL=3K ?isoL?2G ?isoL6K ?isoL+2G ?isoL.The Young modulus follows qualitatively the trend observed for the shear modulus.",contradiction
"As concerns Poisson?s ratio for Ru, Ti, Co, Zr and Mg, it decreases with a grain size, while an opposite relation is found for Re.",contradiction
"Additionally, presented results confirm the observation that for analyzed hcp metals the CS/MT and CS/SC estimates are close to each other.",contradiction
In spite of these two mean-field models figures contain also predictions obtained using the mixture rule-based iso-strain (Voigt) scheme and its counterpart ? an iso-stress Reuss scheme.,contradiction
Those two are upper and lower bounds for stiffness moduli (but not Poisson?s ratio) of a two-phase random polycrystalline medium.,contradiction
Comparing the predictions of all presented averaging models with the atomistic simulations it is seen that on overall the CS/MT scheme can be recommended as delivering reasonable predictions for all hcp metals.,contradiction
"Moreover, consistency of model estimates with the results of atomistic simulations proves validity of the assumed procedure for the assessment of size and average properties for the grain boundary zone.",contradiction
In Kowalczyk-Gajewska and Maz?dziarz (2019) the correlation between the Zener parameter and the character of the relation between effective moduli and the grain size has been found for cubic nanocrystalline metals.,contradiction
"However, in the case of analyzed six hcp metals it is difficult to indicate similar correlation between the anisotropy degree and the grain size effect.",contradiction
"Although Re shows the highest anisotropy degree quantified by ? 0 and AU (see Table 2), it is not that much different from other five metals under study.",contradiction

"The model in Fig. 5(a) does not properly represent U3Si5, resulting in the larger deviations of the calculated curve based on this model from the experimental data compared to the curves obtained based on other structure models (Fig. 6).",contradiction
"Comparing the calculated curves based on the other two structure models in Fig. 6, it is clear that the model in Fig. 5(b) provides a better agreement, but due to its inability to reproduce the elastic anisotropy, it is unlikely to be a proper model for U3Si5.",contradiction
"On the other hand, the model in Fig. 5(c) can reproduce the elastic anisotropy, though it yields a BM-EOS curve that deviates somewhat from the fitted curve to experimental data.",contradiction
"A major difference between these two structures lies in the distribution of Si vacancies as depicted in Fig. 5(b) and (c), and thus it is possible that an intermediate structure would be more appropriate to explain the observed mechanical properties of U3Si5.",contradiction
Evidence of such an intermediate structure in terms of Si vacancy distribution may be found from high-resolution X-ray/neutron diffraction and various spectroscopic analyses.,contradiction
"It can also be useful to compare the derived bulk modulus with that obtained from the axial linear moduli through the relationship [28]:(3)K0,lm=3(1Ma,0+1Ma,0+1Mc,0)?1where M a,0 and M c,0 are the linear moduli as described in Equation (1).",contradiction
"Using the values from Table 2, K0,l m can be calculated using Equation (3), yielding a value of 124.4 ñ 13 GPa.",entailment
This value is in excellent agreement with K0 determined from the pressure-volume data fitted to the BM-EOS (Table 2).,contradiction
"Although there was no experimental determination in the literature of the bulk modulus of U3Si5, a few studies have measured the elastic properties of other U?Si compounds.",contradiction
"More specifically, the bulk moduli of USi2, USi and U3Si2 were determined by high-pressure synchrotron XRD using DAC [16,17].",contradiction
All the experimentally determined K 0 values of U?Si compounds are presented in Table 4 .,contradiction
"An inspection of these values reveals that U3Si5 is the second least compressible of the U?Si compounds studied so far [16,17], and USi2 is the least compressible with the largest bulk modulus of 140 GPa [16].",entailment
Fig. 7 plots the bulk moduli of U?Si compounds (Table 4) as a function of U/(U + Si) ratio.,contradiction
"As is shown, with increasing the U/(U + Si) ratio, the bulk modulus of U?Si decreases and thus its compressibility increases.",contradiction
"This general trend is consistent with the increased contribution of the weaker U?U metallic bond and decreased contribution of the stronger Si?Si covalent bond, as U/(U + Si) increases.",contradiction
The collected XRD patterns as a function of pressure are shown in Fig. 2 .,contradiction
"With increasing pressure, continuous shifts in the XRD peaks to higher 2? are observed, which is indicative of continually decreasing unit-cell parameters, i.e., unit-cell contraction.",contradiction
"Additionally, the absence of any major changes in the XRD patterns (i.e., no emergence, disappearance, or splitting of XRD peaks) suggests that U3Si5 does not undergo any pressure-induced structural phase transition up to the maximum pressure (16.7 GPa) reached in this study.",contradiction
"Decrease in intensity and broadening of peaks become more distinct above ?11 GPa, as the sample chamber becomes less hydrostatic with increasing pressure in the 4:1 methanol: ethanol PTM [23].",contradiction
"In Fig. 3 , the XRD pattern collected at the lowest pressure (2.59 GPa) is shown, along with indexing of the peaks to the dominant U3Si5 phase (model depicted in Fig. 1) and a minor impurity phase, UO2 (space group Fm 3 ? m (No.",contradiction

All peaks except the four peaks marked with an ? are accounted for with these two phases.,contradiction
"The marked peaks are from an unknown phase, which was previously observed in synthesis of U3Si5 [2].",contradiction
"However, as these peaks do not overlap with any reflections of U3Si5, they are not included in the analysis performed.",contradiction
"Additionally, except for shifts to higher 2? due to unit-cell contraction at 2.59 GPa, all peaks agree well with the ambient pressure XRD pattern collected previously [2].",contradiction
"Furthermore, Le Bail analysis was performed on this pattern and all other high-pressure XRD patterns in order to determine unit-cell parameters, a and c, which are listed in Table 1 [25,26].",contradiction
The c/a ratio can be used as a parameter to describe the difference between the structures of U3Si5 and USi2 where a c/a ratio greater than one indicates U3Si5 [37].,contradiction
"From the values in Table 1, it is evident that the c/a ratio remains larger than one at all pressures, indicating the U3Si5 structure [37].",contradiction
"It should also be noted that since data analysis was restricted to Le Bail analysis, the model occupancy of the Si site was unaccounted for in our analysis.",contradiction
"However, as Le Bail analysis is a whole-pattern fitting approach, the unit-cell parameters can be derived accurately for each XRD pattern.",contradiction
"Rietveld refinement, while ideal, was not possible due to the large grain sizes of the loaded sample leading to spotty 2D XRD images.",contradiction
The grain sizes were approximately 20?40 ?m as a 325 mesh was used to separate ground material.,contradiction
"The Le Bail analysis plot (Fig. 3) shows a good agreement between the observed and fitted XRD patterns, as indicated by the small residuals.",contradiction

"In order to characterize the evolution of the unit-cell parameters and cell volume of U3Si5 with pressure, Le Bail analysis was performed for each pressure on the corresponding XRD pattern.",contradiction
"From these analyses, the unit-cell parameters at each pressure were determined and are presented in Table 1 along with the calculated unit-cell volume for the hexagonal structure using these lattice parameters.",contradiction
The estimated standard deviation (ESD) for the cell parameters determined from analysis of each XRD pattern is also given in Table 1 and this ESD is propagated using error analysis to determine the corresponding ESD for the unit-cell volume.,contradiction
The agreement indices R p and R wp are included for each fit to indicate the ?goodness of fit? for each pattern.,contradiction
Fig. 4 presents the variation of unit-cell parameters of U3Si5 (normalized to the fitted ambient pressure cell parameters a 0 and c 0) as a function of pressure.,contradiction
"Upon initial inspection, it is clear that the c-axis contracts more readily than the a-axis.",contradiction
"Quantification of this difference in compressibility can be achieved by fitting the data to the following equations [38]:(1)P=3Ma,02a0a7?a0a5P=3Mc,02c0c7?c0c5where P is pressure, Ma,0 and Mc,0 are the axial linear moduli for the a- and c-axis, respectively, a and c are the unit-cell parameters measured at a given pressure (Table 1), and a0 and c0 are the unit-cell parameters at ambient pressure.",contradiction
"By fitting the values in Table 1 to Equation (1), values of 173 (8) GPa and 79.7 (4.3) GPa are determined for Ma,0 and Mc,0, respectively (Table 2 ).",contradiction
"As the axial compressibility is inversely proportional to the axial moduli, the c-axis of U3Si5 is 2.2 times more compressible than the a-axis.",contradiction
"Additionally, it should be noted that the c/a ratio decreases from 1.046 at 2.59 GPa to 1.032 at 16.7 GPa, indicating a significant anisotropy, though reduced at high pressures.",contradiction
DFT calculations were performed to provide insight into this compressibility anisotropy.,contradiction
"Because the Si sites are partially occupied in U3Si5, various structures have been proposed for U3Si5 in the literature [15,18,39].",contradiction
"To capture its mechanical behavior, three ordered structures and two SQS (Special Quasirandom Structure) structures were used in our calculations.",contradiction
"The first ordered structure is AlB2-type USi2 [P6/mmm, Fig. 5 (a)].",contradiction
This structure represents USi2 without Si vacancy.,contradiction
The second and third structures are derived from the AlB2-type USi2 structure with different distributions of Si vacancies (Fig. 5(b and c)).,contradiction
"The calculated relative lattice constants at high pressures are shown in Fig. 5(d, e, f), and the derived elastic properties of the ordered structures are summarized in Table 3 .",contradiction
The SQS structures were produced with the ICET package [40].,contradiction
"The atomic coordinates and calculated energies of these structures, in the form of VASP POSCAR files, can be found in Table S1 in the supporting materials.",contradiction
It is found that the two SQS structures cannot correctly reproduce the mechanical properties of U3 Si 5 since the calculated c-axis is stiffer than the a-axis (contrary to our experimental result described above).,contradiction
"A SQS structure with a much larger supercell is possibly required to reproduce the mechanical properties of U3Si5, which is computationally more demanding.",contradiction
The ordered structure shown in Fig. 5(b) has been widely used in the literature to model U3Si5 [18].,contradiction
"However, we found that the c-axis of this structure is stiffer than the a- and b-axis (crystallographically equivalent) as indicated by a larger C33 than C11 in Table 3.",contradiction
Similar results were obtained in a previous theoretical study which also used the model depicted in Fig. 5(b) [18].,contradiction
"The calculated a- and c-axial moduli (Ma,0 and Mc,0 in Table 3) for this structure are very different from our experimental results (comparing values between Tables 2 and 3), indicating that this structure is not suitable for modeling the observed elastic behavior of U3Si5.",contradiction
"In contrast, the structures shown in Fig. 5(a) and (c) both correctly describe the anisotropic nature of the mechanical properties observed in the experiment.",contradiction
"However, since the model shown in Fig. 5(a) does not contain Si vacancies and possesses a USi2 stoichiometry, it does not represent the true structure of U3Si5.",contradiction
"Therefore, with regard to the mechanical behavior along individual structural directions, the model represented by Fig. 5(c) is the most accurate among the considered structures for U3Si5.",contradiction
"This anisotropic behavior may be explained by a closer inspection of the structure of U3Si5, shown in Fig. 1.",contradiction
"In the a direction, there are U?U bonds directly along the a-axis, a component of the Si?Si bond (which is parallel to the (001) plane), and a component of the U?Si bond (which is oblique to the a- and c-axis), all of which contribute to the linear modulus in this direction.",contradiction
"In the c direction, there are U?U bonds directly along the c-axis, yet in contrast to the a direction, the only additional contribution in this direction would result from a component of the U?Si bond with no contribution from Si?Si bond.",contradiction
"Thus, the contributions to the linear modulus along the c-axis would likely be different from those along the a-axis.",contradiction
"More importantly, if the relative strengths of these bonds are also taken into account, where U?U would be the weakest and Si?Si bonds the strongest, since U?U bonds are metallic and Si?Si bonds are covalent, then the lack of Si?Si bond component in the c-axis direction is further consistent with the observed anisotropy, i.e., smaller compressibility along the a-axis than along the c-axis.",contradiction
"Although the details of evolution of the atomic positions with pressure have not been determined, it is qualitatively indicative that the lack of the stronger Si?Si bonds in the c direction is responsible for its greater compressibility.",contradiction
"In this study, the high-pressure structural behavior of U3Si5 was explored for the first time up to 16.7 GPa using high-energy angle-dispersive synchrotron XRD coupled with diamond anvil cell technique.",contradiction
The unit-cell parameters and cell volume of U3Si5 were obtained as a function of pressure.,contradiction
"From the pressure dependences of the unit-cell volume and unit-cell parameters a and c, the bulk moduli and the axial linear moduli along the a- and c-axis were derived to be: K 0 = 126 ñ 4 GPa, M a,0 = 173 ñ 8 GPa and M c,0 = 79.7 ñ 4.3 GPa, respectively.",entailment
"Comparison of M a,0 with M c,0 reveals an anisotropy in compressibility with the a-axis being approximately 2.2 times less compressible than the c-axis.",contradiction
"Moreover, our DFT + U calculations yielded bulk and linear moduli that are comparable to the above experimentally determined values using the hexagonal structure (space group P6/mmm).",contradiction
"Although previous DFT calculations also gave similar bulk moduli, the structural models used were inappropriate, as they do not reproduce the compressibility anisotropy between the a- and c-axis.",contradiction
"Finally, compilation of all the measured bulk moduli of U?Si phases, including the value of U3Si5 determined in this study, reveals that the bulk modulus of U?Si decreases with increasing U/(U + Si) ratio.",contradiction
These obtained elastic parameters and relations provide an important basis for assessing U?Si compounds as accident-tolerant fuels in nuclear reactor applications.,contradiction
"Lately, elastic properties of nanodiamonds attracted considerable interest.",contradiction
Experimental studies of ultrasmall nanodiamonds few nanometers in size revealed the increase of bulk modulus up to 20% [1].,contradiction
"Drastic change of elastic properties of ultrasmall nanodiamonds was attributed to the influence of surface reconstruction, which could lead to squeezing of diamond nanoparticles.",contradiction
Subsequent density functional studies seemed to support this claim and 17% increase of bulk modulus for subnanometer carbon clusters was reported [2].,contradiction
"It should be noted, that previous ultrasound measurements on ultrananocrystalline diamond films revealed their inferior elastic properties in comparison to pure single crystal diamond [3,4].",contradiction
"Despite that formation of sp2 bonds on nanodiamond surface causes decreases the length of covalent bonds, it was found recently [5] that structural transformation, induced by surface reconstruction is more complex and, in some cases can lead to the increase of overall lattice parameter of nanodiamonds.",contradiction
"This effect is reliably observed in experiments on nanodiamonds with size less than 2 nm [5,6] and depends not only on crystal size (it decreases with the increase of nanodiamond? size), but is strongly influenced by morphology of nanocrystals, and can even change sign, if particular kind of face is present in the nanocrystal habit.",contradiction
"This is opposite to the conclusions of Ref. [2], that lattice parameter shortening is a universal feature of nanodiamonds, independent on crystal shapes.",contradiction
"To resolve this, we have undertaken the ab-initio investigation of the influence of surface reconstruction on the change in structural and elastic properties of nanosized diamonds.",contradiction
"It should be noted, that on the basic level the bulk modulus B depends on the density of electron gas ? according to the formula: B??5/3 [7,8].",contradiction
This means that 17% increase of nanodiamonds bulk modulus would involves corresponding increase of electron density and hence the decrease of interatomic distances.,contradiction
"Such shortening could potentially be caused by the surface reconstruction, but one may expect these sorts of effects to show along the surface.",contradiction
"So, to simplify the problem, we propose to study the effects caused by surface reconstruction on the lateral properties of nanosized diamond films ? change of it reticular density and the elastic modulus along the surface.",contradiction
"This leaves out the effect caused by reconstruction of edges and corners of nanodiamonds and, of course, confinement effects which depend on the diameter of nanoparticles.",contradiction
"To further restrict our research, we compared effects observed in reconstructed surfaces and the surfaces where broken bonds are capped with hydrogen (that is, nanofilms functionalized with hydrogen).",contradiction
"Still we believe, that effects caused by surface reconstruction per se which are certainly applicable to the determination of elastic properties of atomically thin diamond films also play significant role in the determination of elastic properties of nanodiamonds.",contradiction
In our calculations QuantumESPRESSO software package was used [9].,contradiction
For the density functional calculation we employed the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange correlation method with norm-conserving pseudopotentials with the energy cutoff 100 Ry.,contradiction
"For integration over Brillouin zone, unshifted 4ž4ž1 Monkhorst-Pack grid was used.",contradiction
"The crystal lattices and atom positions at fixed external pressure were fully optimized, until residual force on every atom did not exceed 0.001 Ry/bohr and additional stress ? 0.5 kbar.",contradiction
"As it was done before [5], the properties of nanodiamond were modeled using variously oriented diamond films of subnanometer thickness.",contradiction
"As the changes in structural and elastic properties inversely depend on the nanodiamond size, we took extreme case and investigated the properties of nanofilms consisting of two surface layers, separated by single atomic layer of sp3 hybridized carbon.",contradiction
"Thus total width was approximately 0.5 nm, and comparable to diameter of smallest nanoparticles investigated in Ref. [2], having the largest increase in bulk modulus reported.",contradiction
"In periodic supercell, carbon films were separated by vacuum layer, about twice as thick.",contradiction
"In other words, the investigated structures were obtained by removing 2/3 of atom layers for (111) and (100) diamond films and 5/8 for (110) diamond films.",contradiction
"We took three bare and hydrogenated films, oriented along high symmetry diamond faces (100), (110) and (111).",contradiction
"It was assumed, that reconstruction of diamond surfaces is similar to macroscopic case, which is 1ž1 for (110) and 2ž1 for (111) and (100) bare surfaces.",contradiction
Previous computer simulations [2] demonstrated that for (111) and (110) nanodiamond?s surfaces this types of reconstructions are preserved in the nanoscale.,contradiction
For hydrogenated films we considered only monohydride surfaces.,contradiction
"This means, that for (100) hydrogenated face, additional C?C bond is formed.",contradiction
Investigated films are schematically depicted in Fig. 1 .,contradiction
"Due to intrinsic complications, involved in applying uniform 3D stress on layered structures, we considered biaxial modulus instead of bulk modulus, which is the coefficient between the strain exerted along one axis in response to equal stress applied in two directions.",contradiction
"For cubic crystals it can be expressed as:(1)M=E1??where E is Young?s modulus and ? is Poisson?s ratio [10,11].",contradiction
Biaxial modulus is directly measured in bulge test experiments on thin films [10].,contradiction
"It can be compared to the bulk modulus, which under the same assumptions is equal to:(2)B=E3(1?2?) In density functional theory calculations, the sum of two biaxial moduli of layered structure in two directions can be conveniently obtained as 2V??/?V by full structure relaxation of volume V upon application of pressure (stress ?), while keeping the size of supercell fixed in the direction normal to layers.",contradiction
"In our case, biaxial elastic modulus was calculated by fitting the four values obtained for stresses between 0 and 30 GPa by three-order polynomial of ? vs. ?V/V.",contradiction
"As it was shown before, such a polynomial is an extension of Birch-Murnaghan equation of state for two dimensional materials [12].",contradiction
"On the one hand, it can be regarded as biaxial modulus (measured in GPa) of 3D diamond-related structure where about one third of carbon layers were removed, or, alternatively, it can be related to the single diamond layer.",contradiction
In the latter case after multiplication of the superlattice period in the direction normal to layers and division by two (due to the difference in definitions) it yields elastic modulus which is named layer modulus (M2D measured in N m?1) [12].,contradiction
The results obtained and parameters oft relaxed lattice in orthorhombic setting are presented in Table 1 .,contradiction
The values of layer moduli can be compared to corresponding experimental value of single graphene layer (340 N m?1 [13]).,contradiction
"Calculated layer modulus strongly depends on orientation of nanofilms (and the number of carbon layers, which, in our case, can be considered as an invariant between variously oriented planes).",contradiction
"Still, comparison of layer modulus for hydrogenated and bare (reconstructed) diamond films is nonetheless possible.",contradiction
Hydrogenated films have little variation of in-plane lattice parameters in comparison to diamond ones (see Table 1) and relative dilatation along the surface is in the range ñ 1.5%.,contradiction
"However, reconstruction of bare diamond films leads to stronger variation of lattice parameters and in comparison to the hydrogenated surfaces, the unit cell volume varies in the range ñ5%, as demonstrated by the ratio VH/VBare in Table 1.",contradiction
"In agreement with the previous results [5] for (110) and (100) surfaces, we observed dilatation which changes to contraction for (111) nanofilm.",contradiction
Such change of dimensions leads to the corresponding variation of reticular electron density which results in the corresponding variation of layer moduli: for (111) film we observed a 5% increase in the value of layer moduli and for (100) and (110) an almost 7% decrease.,contradiction
There is clear correlation (shown in Fig. 2 ) between change in linear dimensions of the diamond nanofilms and the values of their layer moduli.,contradiction
"As it was shown earlier [5], we should expect diminishing of dilatation (or contraction) of diamond films with increase of the film thickness, which should be accompanied by corresponding convergence of their elastic moduli to the bulk diamond one.",contradiction
However the direct comparison of calculated elastic modulus with the one of pure bulk diamond is more involved and requires appropriate scaling of so obtained layer modulus for its conversion into the biaxial modulus of diamond nanofilms.,contradiction
Biaxial modulus is connected to layer modulus according to relation M=M2D/d where d is the thickness of the nanofilm.,contradiction
There is a controversy (mentioned in Ref. [2]) of determination of size dimensions of nanosized objects.,contradiction
"However, the first guess is to take the ?nominal? value, determined by the fraction of space occupied by diamond film.",contradiction
"For example, (111) films (bare and hydrogenated) in our simulations were obtained by removing two thirds of single diamond crystal, so, for nanofilms? thickness one should take the value, equal to one third of the lattice spacing in c direction (normal to layers).",contradiction
In this way we implicitly assume that linear electron density in the direction normal to layers is the same in the nanofilm and in bulk diamond.,contradiction
"Despite its simplicity, this approach which takes into account the electron density, is correct.",contradiction
This can be demonstrated by ab-initio calculations.,contradiction
As an example we take (111) nanofilm (see Fig. 3 ).,contradiction
Electron density is a by-product of DFT computation and in Fig. 3 we depict its planar averaged value along planes oriented along nanofilm surface.,contradiction
"Inside the nanofilm there is strong oscillation of electron density with the distance from the middle of nanofilm, but for determination of the average electron density in the nanofilm we propose the fully ab-initio procedure.",contradiction
It can simultaneously evaluate mean electron density in the slab and its thickness.,contradiction
"For the this purpose we approximated the electron density distribution with rectangular shape (in such a way, that mean squared distance between this rectangular shape and the actual electron density distribution will be minimal) under condition, that integral electron density holds constant and equal to actual integral electron density.",contradiction
"Thus defined nanofilm thickness (measured from the middle of the slab) for hydrogenated and bare (111) nanofilms is around 3.18 A? which is in the ñ3 % range of ?nominal? value 3.07 A?T?his means that indeed the linear electron density in nanofilms is approximately the same, as in bulk diamond and that correlation between in-plane dimensions and ratio of elastic modulus for hydrogenated and reconstructed diamond nanofilms (i.e. Fig. 2) also holds for their ?nominal? biaxial moduli.",contradiction
The errors involved in the usage of ?nominal? biaxial modulus values is less than 3% and comparable to the error of the DFT computations.,contradiction
For comparison we also provided calculated biaxial moduli of cubic diamond along corresponding high symmetry planes.,contradiction
"For cubic crystal, the DFT calculation of biaxial moduli using procedure similar to the described above, is impossible due to the lack of control over individual component of stress tensor (we need to apply special type of stress where two of diagonal elements of stress tensor are equal and the third is zero).",contradiction
So for calculation of biaxial modulus along high symmetry planes we use components of stiffness (or rather compliance) tensor.,contradiction
"They are expressed as follows [10,11]:M(100)=(s11+s12)?1M(110)=(s11+s12+cos2?/2)?1M(111)=(s11+s12+s/3)?1where sij are components of the compliance tensor in the Voigt notation, s is an anisotropy parameter s=s44/2?s11+s12 and ? is the angle to (11 ?0) direction.",contradiction
"Because the surfaces are orthogonal, in (110) plane we used the mean value 12((s11+s12+s/2)?1+(s11+s12)?1).",contradiction
"For calculation of the diamond biaxial moduli we used experimental values of compliance tensor sij, corresponding to experimental stiffness constants c11=1079 GPa, c12=124 GPa, c44=578 GPa [10].",contradiction
The stiffnes constants can be calculated by DFT method using standard procedure of applying certain type of strain on diamond lattice but this routine leads to the variation of values within ñ5 % range of experimental one [14].,contradiction
"For hydrogenated films, obtained values of biaxial moduli match quite well with experimental diamond?s ones: for (111) film they are practically equal and for (110) and (100) films are about 10% less.",contradiction
So the hydrogenated diamond films can be considered as representative of single crystal diamond and deviations from hydrogenated films observed on bare diamond films can be considered as effect of surface reconstruction.,contradiction
The calculation of biaxial moduli enables one to estimate the bulk modulus of diamond nanofilms by combinations of Eqs. (1) and (2):(3)B=M(1??)3(1?2?) For this purpose we have to obtain the estimation of Poisson?s ratio of diamond nanofilms ?.,contradiction
It can be estimated from the results of the same procedure used for calculation of biaxial moduli.,contradiction
Under equibiaxial stress and with the same assumptions used in Eqs. (1) and (2) the Poisson?s ratio of the diamond films can be obtained from the variation of film?s thickness (?d) and the variation of its surface area (?S):(4)Sd?d?S=?? ?1?? ? This equation enables one to calculate average Poisson?s ratio ? ? in two perpendicular directions along the film?s plane.,contradiction
For simplicity sake we choose to calculate the Poisson?s ratio only along (111) film where (in pure diamond case) it is constant [11] and equal to 0.079 [10].,contradiction
Variation of relative change of film?s thickness d/d0 vs. relative change of its surface area S/S0 is shown in Fig. 4 .,contradiction
The slope of the linear fit is equal to ?0.097 so the corresponding value of Poisson?s ratio (0.088) does not much differ from the case of single crystal diamond.,contradiction
Estimation of bulk modulus using Eq. (3) yields the value 494 GPa which is about 7% larger than that of single crystal diamond (460 GPa).,entailment
"So, we can conclude, that at the large extent the value of bulk modulus is determined by the change of biaxial modulus, which in its turn is caused by the increase in reticular electron density.",contradiction
"Returning from the nanofilms to the nanodiamonds, the above considerations (based on the data taking into account only the surface reconstruction effects and ignoring effects caused by edges/corners reconstruction and electron confinement) suggests, that overall contraction of diamond nanoparticles is possible, only if reconstructed (111) face is present in their habit.",contradiction
The probability of presence of certain types of face can be estimated from the surface energy.,contradiction
"It turns out, that for reconstructed surfaces the most energetically favorable one has energy gain above 0.5 eV is (111) one with energy 1.19 eV per surface atom [5,15].",contradiction
For monohydride surfaces the most favorable one is (100) with relative energy gain of about 0.3 eV and formation energy equal to 2.18 eV per CH group.,contradiction
In the last case the energy was related to the energy of pure substances with atomic hydrogen (with energy equal to exactly 1 Ry?13.6 eV) taken as reference.,contradiction
"Still there are serious doubts, that reconstructed (111) face is possible in nanodiamonds with size below 2 nm formed at high pressures.",contradiction
"The simulations [16,17] predicted that different type of reconstruction of the (111) face takes place, resulting in exfoliation of nanodiamonds and total graphitization of nanodiamonds of such a small size.",contradiction
"Thus, for ultrananodisperse diamonds we would observe dilatation due to the strain, exerted by the surface reconstruction and subsequently deterioration of their elastic properties, in comparison to the bulk single crystal diamond.",contradiction
"It should be noted that increased lattice parameters calculated on the basis of x-ray diffraction experiments were reported for detonation nanodiamonds (2?12 nm [18], 5?7 nm [19]) with different prehistories and nanodiamonds (5 nm [20]) obtained by laser ablation.",contradiction
"To conclude, our research demonstrated that the reconstruction of surfaces of nanosized diamond films leads to variation of their elastic moduli in the range ?ñ5 % (depending on the orientation of the diamond film) in comparison to the pure single crystal diamond.",contradiction
Possible origin of the discrepancy between our results and research of Ref. [2] where 17% increase of elastic moduli of nanodiamond was reported requires further consideration.,contradiction
It can be connected to effect (disregarded in our research) of reconstructions of corners and edges and in general to confinement effects or to the issues related to the different approaches adopted in DFT calculations.,contradiction

"Compared to the commercial 200 mg Celebrex© capsules, the release of CEL from the CEL-DMSO Formulation D tablets is indeed much faster, largely because of an absence of the lag time resulting from the very fast tablet disintegration process (Fig. 8 ).",contradiction
"After ~2 min lag time before dissolution initiated, the Celebrex© capsules exhibited faster dissolution rate than the tablet, likely because of the smaller particle size of the micronized CEL Form III used in the capsules (Gao et al., 2015).",contradiction
"If needed, the dissolution performance of CEL-DMSO tablet can be improved by using a suitable precipitation inhibitor to slow down or even prevent the crystallization of CEL during the course of dissolution (Ilevbare et al., 2012; Xie and Taylor, 2016; Yamashita and Sun, 2019).",contradiction

"The formulation optimization employed a materials science based decision making process, which invariably starts with clear understanding of deficiencies of a prototype formulation, and is followed by modifying the formulation to specifically address such deficiencies.",contradiction
This successful example highlights the largely neglected but potentially very effective applications of pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in tablet product development.,contradiction
"With pharmaceutical solvates added to the toolbox, one has more flexibility in solving formulation problems through crystal engineering.",contradiction
CEL-DMSO is a 1:1 solvate (space group of P21/c) that crystallizes into hexagonal block shaped crystals (Figure S2).,contradiction
"When heated, he CEL-DMSO solvate is stable, since it does not undergo desolvation before melting.",contradiction
"The DSC thermogram (Fig. 1 a) shows a single sharp endothermic peak (onset temperature of 105.4 ñ 0.02 øC, heat of fusion of 77.06 ñ1.01 J/g, n = 3).",contradiction
"The endothermic event in DSC corresponds to the melting of crystals (ranged 103 øC ? 111 øC) observed by the hot stage microscopy (Fig. 1c, Video S1) , matching well with the range of the DSC endothermic peak.",contradiction
"The absence of desolvation before melting suggests the higher stability of CEL-DMSO than many other solvates and hydrates in the literature, which routinely lose solvent molecule before melting (Aitipamula et al., 2014; Han et al., 1998; Machiste, 1995; Zhu et al., 2019), including 6 isostructural cocrystal solvates of CEL (Wang et al., 2014).",contradiction
"Thus, CEL-DMSO displays adequate physical stability important for pharmaceutical tablet formulation development.",contradiction
"The high stability of CEL-DMSO is attributed to the fact that two CEL molecules and two DMSO molecules form a tetramer (Fig. 2 a), which is the basic building block of the CEL-DMSO crystal structure.",contradiction
"Each tetramer is stabilized by four strong R42(8) hydrogen bonds, which can be split into two crystallographically equivalent pairs (labeled 1/1? and 2/2?) (Fig. 2a, Table 1 ).",contradiction
"The DMSO molecules reside in zig-zag channels of the CEL-DMSO crystal structure and stabilized by strong interactions with CEL molecules (Fig. 2b, S3).",contradiction
These structural features all contribute to the good stability of CEL-DMSO.,contradiction
"The TGA curve shows that the total weight loss did not reach the theoretical DMSO content of 17 wt% in CEL-DMSO crystals until approximately 230 øC (Fig. 1b), which is about 40 øC higher than the boiling point of DMSO (189 øC).",contradiction
"Since pure CEL liquid starts to evaporate at temperatures above 200 øC (Fig. 1b), a part of the weight loss of CEL-DMSO solvate around 230 øC is attributed to CEL.",contradiction
"Therefore, DMSO was not completely removed from the CEL-DMSO melt at 230 øC.",contradiction
"This is possible if DMSO and CEL form an azeotrope in liquid phase, which is likely, given the stability of tetramers (Fig. 2a).",contradiction
"Similar phenomenon was observed in CEL mono-NMP solvate crystals (Wang et al., 2020b).",contradiction
The high solid-state stability of CEL-DMSO is important for removing the surface residual DMSO without causing desolvation.,contradiction
Phase pure CEL-DMSO powder was obtained by spraying deionized water onto the CEL-DMSO powder during vacuum filtration and then dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 3 days with air flowing over the powder.,contradiction
The CEL-DMSO powder was also stable upon storage in a closed scintillation vial placed on a laboratory bench at ambient conditions for at least 9 months (until the time of manuscript writing).,contradiction
"Additionally, the CEL-DMSO was stable against compaction pressure since the XRD pattern of a tablet (200 mg) compressed at 325 MPa showed no sign of any new solid phases when compared to the PXRD pattern calculated from room temperature single crystal structure (Fig. 3 ).",contradiction
"Therefore, no phase stability related issues are expected during API preparation and tablet manufacturing.",contradiction
"It is also useful to point out that the DMSO molecules and -CF3 group of CEL in the crystal are disordered at 298 K, but not at 100 K (Figure S2b,c).",contradiction
"Thus, the two disordered sites correspond to slightly different interaction energies, with the energy difference comparable in magnitude to the kinetic energy difference of the molecules between the two temperatures.",contradiction
"At 298 K, the position of O atoms to the two disordered DMSO molecules (with occupancies of 0.84 and 0.16) only differ slightly, maintaining the tetramer structure by forming hydrogen bonds with the sulfonamide N-H of CEL.",contradiction
The disorder at 298 K did not significantly affect the overall crystal packing of CEL-DMSO.,contradiction
CEL-DMSO exhibited a higher intrinsic dissolution rate than CEL in DI water at 23.5 øC (Figure S4).,contradiction
"However, the conversion of CEL-DMSO to CEL Form III occurred quickly (in 10 ? 30 s) during IDR measurements.",contradiction
"Therefore, washing CEL-DMSO with water to remove residual DMSO requires careful monitoring of phase purity and, if conversion to Form III occurs, control of phase purity during large scale manufacturing.",contradiction
"The elastic modulus (E) and hardness (H) are important parameters that could potentially be used to predict tableting performance of APIs (Shi and Sun, 2011; Taylor et al., 2004; Varughese et al., 2013).",contradiction
"CEL crystals are elastic (Wang et al., 2019), with a E of 16.27ñ0.43 GPa and an H of 0.45ñ0.02 GPa when the (001) crystal face was indented.",contradiction
"Therefore, CEL falls in the category of stiff crystals based on E but intermediate-stiffness based on H (Wang and Sun, 2020).",contradiction
"This is consistent with the poor tabletability of CEL since materials with high E values are generally poorly compressible and tend to form laminated tablets due to elastic recovery in die (Shi and Sun, 2011).",contradiction
"Compared to CEL, the elasticity of CEL-DMSO is greatly reduced, with an E of 5.57 ñ 0.31 GPa when indented on the major (002) crystal face.",contradiction
"This places CEL-DMSO in the category of compliant molecular crystals (Wang and Sun, 2020).",contradiction
The H of the (002) face of CEL-DMSO (0.29ñ0.02 GPa) is also much lower than CEL.,contradiction
"However, the CEL-DMSO crystal also fractured during the nanoindentation test (Fig. 4 ), indicating higher brittleness of CEL-DMSO than CEL.",contradiction
"The tabletability profile of CEL-DMSO powder is significantly lower than CEL (Fig. 5 a), which may be partially attributed to the brittleness of CEL-DMSO crystals.",contradiction
"For example, more brittle materials tend to develop defects in the tablets during decompression, which generally leads to poorer tabletability.",contradiction
"Hence, the inclusion of a plastic excipient in the formulation is needed for tablet formulation of CEL-DMSO to avoid compaction related problems.",contradiction
"In this regard, MCC is a good candidate because of its high plasticity and excellent tabletability (Paul and Sun, 2017b; Sun and Himmelspach, 2006; Thoorens et al., 2014).",contradiction
"Although the longest dimensions were similar (Figure S1), the flowability index (ffc ) of CEL-DMSO powder (7.1ñ 0.2) was about twice of the ffc of CEL powder (4.0 ñ 0.3).",contradiction
The bulk density of CEL-DMSO (0.64 g/cm3) was also higher than CEL Form III (0.11 g/cm3).,contradiction
"The improved flowability of CEL-DMSO is attributed to its more equi-dimensional block shape, which is more favorable to powder flow than the needle like particles, such as CEL crystals (Figure S1).",contradiction
"The lower aspect ratio of CEL-DMSO crystals alleviates the detrimental effect of particle entanglement among needle-shaped crystals on powder flowability (Hou and Sun, 2008).",contradiction
"Despite the improvement, the flowability of CEL-DMSO is still poorer than that of Avicel pH 102 (ffc  = 12.2 ñ 0.8), which exhibits flowability minimally required for high speed tableting (Sun, 2010).",contradiction
"However, the improved flowability of CEL-DMSO is expected to facilitate the development of a DC tablet formulation with the aid of functional excipients.",contradiction
"Based on the flowability and tabletability of CEL-DMSO, we first designed a DC tablet formulation (Formulation A) containing 50% CEL-DMSO (Table 2 ).",contradiction
This formulation corresponds to 200 mg CEL when the total tablet weight is 500 mg.,contradiction
"Formulation A also has 23% MCC (as the plastic binder to enhance tablet strength), mannitol Pearlitol 100SD (to enhance the flow of the formulation) (Paul et al., 2018), crospovidone (as a disintegrant) (Gordon et al., 1993), SLS (as a dual functionality wetting agent and lubricant) (Dun et al., 2018), and MgSt (as a lubricant) (Ertel and Carstensen, 1988).",contradiction
Formulation A (ffc  = 14.1ñ1.6) exhibited significantly better flowability than both CEL-DMSO alone and Avicel PH102.,contradiction
"When CEL-DMSO in Formulation A was replaced by CEL, the profoundly deteriorated flowability (ffc  = 3.7ñ0.1) was similar to that of CEL.",contradiction
"Thus, at 50% CEL loading, the flowability of the formulation is dominated by CEL.",contradiction
"At this drug loading, the use of the better flowing CEL-DMSO leads to profound improvement in the flowability of the formulation.",contradiction
"Additionally, CEL containing Formulation A could not be made into intact tablets at compaction pressures below 119 MPa and a 20 ms dwell time due to severe lamination (Figure S5).",contradiction
"When CEL-DMSO was used in Formulation A, all tablets were intact below 300 MPa but mild lamination occurred at higher pressures, hinted by hairline cracks on the side of tablets.",contradiction
"Since faster compression aggravates tablet capping and lamination (Garr and Rubinstein, 1991; Paul and Sun, 2017a), a slower speed (corresponding to a dwell time of 100 ms) was used to make intact tablets for delineating their tabletabilities.",contradiction
"At this speed, the tabletabilities of the two formulations were comparable, and sufficiently strong tablets (>2 MPa tensile strength) could be made for both formulations (Figure S6a).",contradiction
"However, the ejection force of CEL-DMSO Formulation A, ~ 550 N at 150 MPa compaction pressure (Figure S6b), is higher than the preferred 400 N (Chen et al., 2019).",contradiction
"Thus, Formulation A requires optimization to be suitable for commercial manufacturing.",contradiction
"To minimize possible damages of high ejection force to tablets and dies during large scale commercial manufacturing, two changes were made to arrive at Formulation B (Table 2), i.e., 1) increasing the amount of MgSt from 0.25 wt% to 0.75 wt% to reduce the ejection force; and 2) using more of the plastic MCC to replace some of the brittle mannitol to mitigate the lamination issue at high compaction pressures.",contradiction
"Since CEL-DMSO is brittle (Fig. 4b), the loading of active crystals was also reduced from 50 wt% to 40 wt%.",contradiction
This necessitates a larger tablet (600 mg) to deliver 200 mg of CEL equivalent dose (Table 2).,contradiction
"The ffc of CEL-DMSO containing Formulation B is 14.0 ñ 0.01, indicating its satisfactory flowability for high speed tableting.",contradiction
"However, very slight hairline cracks on the side of tablets were still observed at high compaction pressures.",contradiction
"Therefore, the formulation composition changes did alleviate the observed lamination problem, but further formulation optimization is needed to eliminate it.",contradiction
"We, therefore, replaced all mannitol in Formulation B with MCC (Table 2) to further reduce the brittleness of the formulation.",contradiction
"However, the elimination of freely flowing mannitol also likely deteriorates the flowability of the formulation.",contradiction
"Hence, silica nanocoated MCC was used to ensure sufficient flowability for high speed tablet manufacturing (Zhou et al., 2012).",contradiction
This strategy was successful as indicated by the high ffc of CEL-DMSO containing Formulation C (22.0ñ2.7).,contradiction
"Importantly, defect-free tablets were made in the entire pressure range at 20 ms dwell time.",contradiction
"However, since the ejection force is still slightly too high, ranging from 556 to 725 N, we increased the amount of MgSt to 1 wt% to arrive at the Formulation D (Table 2).",contradiction
"As expected, the ejection force profile of Formulation D is much improved over Formulation C, with ejection force lower than 400 N in the entire pressure range (Figure S7).",contradiction
"Thus, at the 1% level, MgSt is effective in addressing the high ejection force issue.",contradiction
We then assessed Formulation D against other important requirements for successful tablet manufacturing.,contradiction
"As expected from the minor change in formulation, the ffc of CEL-DMSO containing Formulation D (19.0ñ1.7) is comparable to that of Formulation C.",contradiction
"Thus, its excellent flowability retained.",contradiction
The replacement of CEL-DMSO in Formulation D with CEL significantly deteriorated flowability (ffc  = 4.5ñ0.1).,contradiction
"Clearly, the better flowability of CEL-DMSO is still translated into better flowability of the tablet formulation even at 40% loading (Fig. 5b).",contradiction
"The CEL-DMSO containing Formulation D also exhibited adequate tabletability, although it is slightly lower than that of the CEL-containing Formulation D (Fig. 5a).",contradiction
"Therefore, similar to flowability, the different tabletabilities of the two solid forms also significantly impacted tabletabilities of their corresponding formulations.",contradiction
"So far, Formulation D exhibits excellent flowability, adequate tabletability (with tablets free from lamination), and acceptable ejection force.",contradiction
"The low bulk density of the CEL-based Formulation made it impossible to prepare tablets with the desired tablet weight using the CEL-containing Formulation D, where 500 mg of powder could not all be fit into the die even at the maximum filling depth (Figure S8).",contradiction
Slight compression of the powder with a gloved finger was required to fill the entire mass into the die.,contradiction
"However, no intact tablets could be made at 20 ms dwell time due to severe lamination upon ejection (Fig. 6 a,b).",contradiction
"In contrast, intact tablets could be made from the CEL-DMSO based Formulation D under identical compression conditions (Fig. 6c).",contradiction
"Overall, the CEL-DMSO based Formulation D exhibits adequate manufacturability.",contradiction
"Hence, it is further examined for friability and dissolution to confirm its suitability for developing a DC tablet product of CEL.",contradiction
"Low friability is a critical quality attribute for tablets to avoid excessive loss of weight during handling, shipping, and storage.",contradiction
"It also affects packaging of the final tablet product, where individual blister packaging may be needed for friable tablets to protect their integrity, while tablets with low friability can be filled into bottles in bulk.",contradiction
"Typically, tablet friability is expected to be less than 1% (USP, 2016).",contradiction
"However, tablet friability of a given formulation depends on tablet size and mechanical strength, which is in turn affected by tableting speed, compression force, and tooling design.",contradiction
"A suitable set of compression conditions can be determined from a friability profile, obtained from a material-sparing and expedited method (Osei-Yeboah and Sun, 2015).",contradiction
"In this work, the expedited friability test of CEL-DMSO Formulation D tablets compressed at 20 ms dwell time using flat-faced round tooling (Fig. 7 a) suggests that tablets with < 1% friability can be obtained in the compression force range of 4.6 ? 21.7 kN.",contradiction
"Below 4.6 kN, tablets are friable because of low mechanical strength.",contradiction
"Above 21.7 kN, tablets are friable likely because of defects introduced into tablets as a result of high extent of elastic recovery.",contradiction
The latter mechanism is supported by the coincidence of rising tablet friability (Fig. 7a) and the deflection of the in-die elastic recovery profile at 10 kN compression force (Fig. 7b).,contradiction
The link between elastic recovery and friabiity is further supported by the effects of tableting speed on friability and elastic recovery.,contradiction
"At a slower speed, corresponding to a dwell time of 30 ms, both friability and elastic recovery are overall lower than those at higher speed (20 ms dwell time) (Fig. 7).",contradiction
"This is sensible because longer dwell time allows particles to undergo a larger extent of plastic deformation, which both dissipates more elastic energy and increases tablet strength (Tye et al., 2005).",contradiction
"With the 30 ms dwell time, the friability and in-die elastic recovery at 7.5 kN is predicted from corresponding profiles to be ~0.5% and ~4.6%, respectively (Fig. 7a).",contradiction
"These agree reasonably well with the three tablets made at 7.4ñ0.1 kN, exhibiting a friability of 0.47 ñ 0.09% and an elastic recovery of 4.5 ñ 0.2%.",contradiction
"We have successfully developed a direct compression tablet formulation of CEL using the DMSO solvate of CEL, which exhibits better flowability and tabletability than the commercial Form III CEL.",contradiction
CEL also releases more quickly from the tablet than CEL capsules.,contradiction
The formulation development process was efficient because of the employment of predictive techniques for assessing powder flowability and tableting performance.,contradiction
This study exemplifies the benefits of combining crystal engineering and materials science to enable the efficient development of high quality tablet products.,contradiction
Oxide Dispersion Strengthened advanced ferritic steels are studied for fuel clad and wrapper core components in fast spectrum reactors [1].,contradiction
"Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic steels have very good strength and resistance against irradiation damage, high temperature creep and corrosion.",contradiction
These steels are generally produced through mechanical alloying and subsequent extrusion or forging.,contradiction
The resistance of the ODS steels to degradation by high temperature and irradiation is attributed to the oxide nanoparticles dispersed in the steel matrix.,contradiction
These highly stable densely dispersed oxide nanoparticles obstruct the dislocation motion and grain boundary sliding leading to stable microstructure at elevated temperatures [2?10].,contradiction
Sustaining the superior performance of the steels in the severe reactor environment under long-term service is important for the efficient operation of the nuclear power plants [6].,contradiction
"Therefore, the characterization of the oxide nanoparticles in ODS steels have been an active research field [8?18].",contradiction
"A large number of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies have shown that most of these oxide nanoclusters in ODS steels with proper amounts of Y, Ti and O are near-stoichiometric Y2Ti2O7 pyrochlore oxides [19].",contradiction
Ribis et al. have studied the response of the nano-oxides in ODS steels to neutron and ion irradiation [16].,contradiction
This work shows that irradiation cause an increase in size and a decrease in density of the Y2Ti2O7 particles.,contradiction
Lu et al. have studied a 9Cr ODS steel using heavy ion irradiation and TEM to understand the relationship between its swelling resistance and the stability of the oxide dispersion.,contradiction
"They have shown, in contrast, that the average size of the oxide particles decrease dramatically and their density increases sharply with irradiation damage.",contradiction
"This work further shows that the oxide dispersion observed after irradiation has no distinct lattice structure and they are not Y2Ti2O7, Y2TiO5, or Y2O3 [17].",contradiction
"Thus, it is desirable to identify better dispersion capable of retaining/improving the strength and stability of the ODS steel.",contradiction
"In view of this, Takahashi and Tanaka have studied the formation energy of 29 different A2B2O7 pyrochlore-type oxides in bcc iron matrix and their influence on the bulk moduli of the iron matrix through first principles calculation and data mining [20].",contradiction
They have predicted that Y2Zr2O7 and Y2Ti2O7 are good candidates as stable and suitable oxide dispersion for ODS steel.,contradiction
"On the other hand, Hirata et al. have shown that the oxide nanoclusters in ODS steel are defective TiO particles with NaCl (B1-type) structure [9].",contradiction
The chemical composition and structure of the oxide dispersions have actually been a matter of debate [19].,contradiction
Brandes et al. have reported that these fine oxide particles lack an identifiable crystal structure [11].,contradiction
"From atom probe tomography characterization of the chemistry of the nanoclusters in ODS steels, Boutard et al. have determined YO, TiO, and O2 clusters with a mean composition of YTiO2, unrelated to any stoichiometric compound [21].",contradiction
These studies thus indicate that the B1-type TiO is also a potential candidate dispersion for ODS steel.,contradiction
"This view is further supported by several studies on improving the properties of ODS steels where B1-type oxides (MgO, CaO, BaO, SrO) have been included in the investigation of their ability to trap He atoms in the iron matrix, influence on mechanical and microstructural properties and resistance to irradiation [12?14].",contradiction
"Despite this, no study has directly investigated the stability of B1-type oxides in bcc iron.",contradiction
"Further, Siska et al. have studied the strengthening mechanisms of different oxide particles in 9Cr ODS steel at high temperatures [22].",contradiction
Oono et al. have studied the precipitation of various oxides in ODS ferritic steels [23].,contradiction
"Dou et al. have studied the effects of Al, Zr, and Ti content on the crystal and metal-oxide interface structures of the oxide particles in several ODS steels by high resolution TEM for understanding the formation, transformation and irradiation tolerance of various kinds of oxide dispersions [18].",contradiction
"However, the list of oxides to be investigated as dispersion in ODS steels have not been well established.",contradiction
"In view of this, and in order to gain a comprehensive insight on the structure and stability of the B1-type oxide dispersions, we compute the formation energy of 31 different B1-type oxides in bcc iron and the bulk moduli of the oxide embedded iron matrix.",contradiction
We refer these B1-type oxides as MO oxides with M substituted by the 31 different elements.,contradiction
"We show that oxides, such as, TaO, MnO, AlO, SiO, ZrO, ScO, ZnO, MgO and SnO constitute stable oxides in the iron matrix, which tend to retain the bulk modulus of the iron matrix.",contradiction
"Whereas, oxides, such as, TiO, VO, CrO, FeO, CoO, NiO, MoO, RuO, RhO, HfO, WO, ReO, OsO, and IrO are chemically less stable in the iron matrix though the bulk modulus is retained.",contradiction
The paper is organized as follows.,contradiction
"After the introduction in Section 1, the computational scheme is outlined briefly in Section 2.",contradiction
"In Section 3, we present the equilibrium structure of the embedded oxides, their formation energies, the bulk moduli of the oxide embedded bcc iron, and discuss the mechanism behind the exothermic or endothermic formation energies and the variation in the bulk moduli.",contradiction
Section 4 gives summary of the salient results.,contradiction
We model the B1-type oxides in iron by placing a M4O4 cluster in a 4ž4ž4 bcc Fe supercell with 128 sites.,contradiction
This M4O4 cluster is created by replacing 2 nearest neighbor Fe atoms with 2 M atoms each on two adjacent (110) planes and by placing an O atom at the nearest octahedral interstitial sites to each of the 4 M atoms.,contradiction
The pair of M atoms on the given (110) plane is rotated by 90? with respect to the other pair on the adjacent (110) plane.,contradiction
"When these 4 M and 4 O atoms are linked, they form a simple tetragonal cell resembling the simple cubic cell with 4 Na and 4 Cl atoms placed alternatively at its corners constituting one eighth of the conventional B1-type NaCl unit cell.",contradiction
This is illustrated in Fig. 1 .,contradiction
Thus the M4O4 unit is placed in the bcc Fe supercell such that the M's substitute Fe and O's occupy the associated octahedral interstitial sites in the same manner as all Cl atoms occupy the octahedral holes in the bcc Na to give the B1-type NaCl crystal structure.,contradiction
This work considers 31 different elements for M.,contradiction
Table 1 collects the crystallographic data of these MO oxides.,contradiction
The formation energy (Ef) of the M4O4 oxide in the bulk bcc iron is calculated from the following expression [20]:(1)Ef(M4O4)=E(Fe124M4O4)?124128E(Fe128)?E(M4O4)where E(Fe124M4O4) and E(Fe128) are respectively the total energies of the supercells containing the oxide cluster M4O4 and pure bcc Fe.,contradiction
E(M4O4) is the total energy of the free M4O4 cluster.,contradiction
The formation energy in this work thus represents the energy related to dissolving M4O4 as a single entity in the bcc iron matrix.,contradiction
It is similar to the formation energy of elemental solutes in a crystal [28].,contradiction
It does not represent dissolving M4O4 unit into elemental M's and O's in the iron matrix.,contradiction
Positive formation energy represents endothermic reaction of M4O4 with Fe matrix while negative formation energy represents exothermic reaction.,contradiction
"For the calculation of the total energies required in Eq. (1), we used the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package [29,30] which implements the density functional theory using pseudopotentials and plane waves.",contradiction

Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation was used for the exchange and correlation interactions [33].,contradiction
Spin polarized calculations were performed for all the systems considered in this work as bcc Fe is a ferromagnetic substance.,contradiction

The Kohn-Sham orbitals were expanded in plane waves with cutoff energy of 450 eV.,contradiction
"For all the bulk calculations, a 4ž4ž4 special k-points mesh generated using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme was used to sample the Brillouin zone.",contradiction
"All structural degrees of freedom, i.e., ionic coordinates, size and shape of the simulation cell, were allowed to relax in these calculations.",contradiction
We note here that the convergence of the self consistent field (SCF) iterations have not been straightforward for several of the Fe124M4O4 systems.,contradiction
"For these cases, the total energy calculations were performed in several steps.",contradiction
"First, with the given k-points mesh (2ž2ž2), plane wave kinetic energy cutoff (400 eV) and total energy convergence criterion (10?4), the ionic positions were allowed to change with fixed cell shape and volume.",contradiction
"Then, along with the ionic positions, the cell shape was also allowed to change with the fixed cell volume.",contradiction
"After this, all the structural degrees of freedom (ionic positions, cell shape and volume) were allowed to change, first at the cutoff of 400 eV then at 450 eV.",contradiction
"Next, the total energy convergence criterion was increased gradually from 10?4 to 10?7.",contradiction
"Finally, the k-points mesh was increased from 2ž2ž2 to 3ž3ž3 to 4ž4ž4.",contradiction
"We note further that, for some systems, the self consistent field iterations were unstable and did not converge when the cutoff was increased to 500 eV.",contradiction
"Hence, the convergence with respect to cutoff energy were tested with systems where the SCF iterations were stable from 450 to 600 eV in steps of 50 eV.",contradiction
These calculations showed that the total energies were converged within 0.12 eV/Fe124M4O4.,contradiction
"Therefore, all the calculations have been performed with 450 eV cutoff energy.",contradiction
The total energy of the free M4O4 clusters were calculated by placing them in a fixed 15 A? cubic box and solving their Kohn-Sham equations.,contradiction
"For magnetic oxides, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO, spin polarized calculations were performed.",contradiction
These ? k-point calculations allow relaxation of the positions of all the atoms.,contradiction
The free M4O4 clusters were initially made in the form of a cubic cell resembling the simple cubic cell with 4 M and 4 O atoms placed alternatively at its corners constituting one eighth of the conventional NaCl (B1) unit cell.,contradiction
"Besides formation energies, we have also calculated the bulk modulus of the oxide embedded iron by fitting their E(V) data to the Vinet equation of state [34].",contradiction
We have seen that the formation energies are endothermic for some oxides and exothermic for other oxides.,contradiction
"Since the formation energies are manifestation of bonding between Fe, M and O atoms, we analyzed the projected electronic density of states of the oxide embedded iron to gain more insight into the origin of the exothermic and endothermic formation energies.",contradiction
"Fig. 7 shows the projected density of state of s or d electrons of M, d electrons of nearest Fe and the p electrons from O atoms.",contradiction
We see that the p density of states are placed almost over the same energy range with similar hybridization with the Fe and M density of states.,contradiction
Whereas the s or d density of states from M's exhibit distinguishable degrees of overlap with the d density of states from nearest Fe.,contradiction
"That is, the M's with exothermic formation energy for MO, such as NiO, RhO and IrO, exhibit strong overlap with the Fe d density of states while the M's with endothermic formation energy for MO, such as MgO, YO and ZrO, exhibit weak overlap with the Fe density of states.",contradiction
"We also see from (a), (b), and (c) panels of Fig. 7 that the hybridization between Mg-s and Fe-d is negligible compared to that between Y-d and Fe-d, and between Zr-d and Fe-d states.",contradiction
"This leads to relatively large positive formation energy for MgO, which makes it to deviate from the correlation between the formation energy and volume in Fig. 3.",contradiction
"Looking at the DOS in the (d), (e), and (f) panels of Fig. 7, we see that the hybridization between Ir-d and Fe-d over ?6 to 0 eV is strong compared to that between Ni-d and Fe-d, and between Rh-d and Fe-d.",contradiction
"(Ir-d band width and the area under Ir-d occupied DOS are more compared to those of Ni-d and Rh-d DOS.) This strong hybridization between Ir and Fe states leads to relatively large exothermic formation energy for IrO in the iron matrix, causing its deviation from the correlation in Fig. 3.",contradiction
We note further that most of the MO's derive their mechanism for the endothermic or exothermic formation energies from the degree of overlap between valence electron density of states from M and Fe atoms.,contradiction
"Before analyzing the structure of the M4O4 clusters placed in the iron matrix, we examined their relaxed structure without the iron matrix.",contradiction
It is found that most of the relaxed free M4O4 clusters remain intact as a single entity though distorted relative to the initial cubic form.,contradiction
The free He4O4 and Os4O4 clusters are not intact.,contradiction
The He4O4 cluster relaxes into two O2 clusters and 4 isolated He atoms.,contradiction
The Os4O4 cluster relaxes to Os2O4 and two isolated Os atoms.,contradiction
Table 2 gives the calculated equilibrium bond lengths in each of the 31 M4O4 free clusters.,contradiction
First row gives the initial bond lengths which corresponds to the experimental values in B1-type TiO.,contradiction
"We see that, in most cases, the calculated M-O, M-M, and O-O bond lengths are somewhat reduced relative to their respective experimental values wherever available.",contradiction
"As noted above, the relaxed He-He bond length is significantly large compared to the initial M-M bond.",contradiction
"For OsO, the listed bond lengths correspond to Os2O4 cluster.",contradiction
"In the initial cubic cluster, M-M and O-O bond lengths are same.",contradiction
"Therefore, the difference between the M-M and O-O relaxed bond lengths are an indication of the distortion of the M4O4 clusters from the cubic form.",contradiction
Comparison of the differences between M-M and O-O bonds shows that majority of the O-O bonds are expanded relative to the M-M bonds.,contradiction
Next we inspected the structure of all the Fe124M4O4 systems.,contradiction
"The positions of M, O and the surrounding Fe atoms and the associated bond lengths are found modified in the relaxed systems.",contradiction
Table 3 lists the relaxed bond lengths.,contradiction
"For reference, initial bond lengths are listed in the first row of the table.",contradiction
The two bond lengths under the different category of bonds correspond to the first and second neighbor bonds.,contradiction
They are listed together since the difference between them is small in bcc lattice.,contradiction
It is evident from columns 6 and 7 of the table that the relaxed supercells remain cubic for most systems with a small deviation within 3%.,contradiction
This deviation from cubic form is slightly higher than 3% for Sr4O4 and Y4O4 embedded supercells.,contradiction
"Further, similar to the free clusters, the calculated M-O, M-M, and O-O bond lengths are generally comparable or reduced with reference to their respective experimental values.",contradiction
Some of the O-O bonds in CuO and MnO show appreciable increase and decrease respectively relative to experimental values.,contradiction
"Compared to the initial M-O bond lengths, respective relaxed nearest and next nearest neighbor bond lengths for most of the systems are increased by up to 46% and 12% respectively.",contradiction
"For Au-O, Ba-O and Sr-O, the increase in the first neighbor bond length reaches to 70%.",contradiction
Corresponding increase in second neighbor bond length is higher than 12%.,contradiction
"First and second neighbor bonds of O with Fe atoms of the surrounding matrix, i.e., Fe-O bonds, are also expanded by up to 32% and 6% relative to the respective initial bond lengths.",contradiction
"In some systems, the second neighbor Fe-O bonds are either comparable to the initial values or reduced slightly (MgO, NiO, TiO, VO).",contradiction
First and second neighbor M-M bond lengths (except He-He bond) are increased by up to 37% and 22% respectively.,contradiction
First and second neighbor O-O bond lengths are generally expanded by up to 28% and 14% respectively.,contradiction
The increase in the O-O bond lengths in Au4O4 is exceptionally large.,contradiction
"Some of the second neighbor O-O bond lengths are reduced relative to the initial values (WO, AlO, MoO).",contradiction
"Nevertheless majority of the (i) M4O4 units remain intact with M and O atoms bonded as in the beginning of the structural optimization, since the changes in bond lengths described above are toward their experimental values in the respective oxides as discussed in the previous paragraph.",contradiction
"In Table 3, we have two lengths for M-O, M-M and O-O bonds whereas they are single values in free M4O4 clusters in Table 2.",contradiction
This is because our M4O4 placed in the iron matrix is tetragonal while free M4O4 is cubic.,contradiction
"That is, the two values for M-O, M-M and O-O bonds are measures of tetragonal distortions of the M4O4 clusters.",contradiction
"If these two bond lengths for each of the M-O, M-M, and O-O bonds become same or comparable after relaxation, with the difference between M-M and O-O bonds are reduced, it is an indication that the embedded M4O4 units tend to transform from the tetragonal form to the cubic form.",contradiction
Comparison of these pairs of bond lengths shows that most of the oxides tend to transform to the cubic form from the initial tetragonal form but the difference between the average M-M and O-O bond lengths keep them deformed.,contradiction
"We note here that the oxide nanoparticles in 14YWT ODS steel, as mentioned earlier, is reported to have the NaCl (B1-type) structure [9].",contradiction
The same authors subsequently reported that the oxide nanoparticles rather have TlI-like structure which can be regarded as a deformed NaCl structure [35].,contradiction
"In Ca4O4 and Sr4O4, the transformation from tetragonal to cubic form is almost complete.",contradiction
We also note that the M-M bonds are generally larger than the O-O bonds for most of the oxides.,contradiction
"Whereas, in BaO, CaO, and SrO, the M-M bond lengths are less than or equal to the respective O-O bond lengths.",contradiction
"He4O4, Au4O4 and Si4O4 are exceptions.",contradiction
"In the former two systems (ii and iii), He and Au atoms stay close to their respective substitutional positions.",contradiction
Whereas the O atoms detach from He and Au atoms and attach with neighboring Fe atoms.,contradiction
"Correspondingly, the Fe-O bond lengths are relatively shorter in these systems.",contradiction
"Further, while the O atoms from He4O4 are still located near their original octahedral interstitial sites after relaxation, the O atoms from Au4O4 are relaxed to the next tetrahedral interstitial sites.",contradiction
O atoms detaching from He and Au atoms and attaching with neighboring Fe atoms may be understood as follows: Noble elements He and Au with negligible reaction with O atoms allow them to leave them.,contradiction
Fe atoms react readily with O atoms to produce Fe-O oxides hence attachment with Fe atoms.,contradiction
"Si4O4 (iv) relaxes to four SiO pairs, located approximately at their respective initial positions.",contradiction
This is because the difference between the first and second nearest neighbor Si-O and O-O bond lengths have become larger than the initial lengths.,contradiction
"These 4 different patterns of relaxation (YO, HeO, AuO, SiO) are shown in Fig. 2 .",contradiction
"Thus, majority of the MO clusters including MgO, AlO, TiO, MnO, NiO, YO, ZrO and HfO remain intact as M4O4 units in Fe matrix with some amount of distortion from the cubic form.",contradiction
Analysis of relaxed bond lengths further shows that the Fe matrix surrounding the M4O4 clusters is expanded.,contradiction
"We note here that Erhart has studied the energetics of helium atoms at the oxide-iron interfaces, considering various oxides (Al2O3, TiO2, Y2O3, YAlO3, Y3Al5O12, Y4Al2O9, MgO, CaO, BaO, SrO) to identify better oxides to make swelling resistant ODS steels for application in the fusion environments [12].",contradiction
Brodric et al. have studied the mechanism for irradiation damage resistance in Y2O3 dispersion strengthened steels through the energetics of 4 distinct Y2O3-Fe interfaces.,contradiction
"They have shown that these interfaces act as strong traps for both interstitial and vacancy defects, facilitating recombination without altering the interface structure.",contradiction
This catalytic elimination of defects is considered to be the mechanism behind the improved performance of ODS steels with respect to irradiation creep and swelling [36].,contradiction
Our work shows that the degree of distortion of the M4O4 clusters embedded in the iron matrix span over a range.,contradiction
"Thus, it will be interesting to investigate the helium trapping capability of these oxide-iron interfaces.",contradiction
The formation energies of MO oxides in bcc iron are collected in Table 4 .,contradiction
"Equilibrium volumes, bulk moduli and their pressure derivatives for all the Fe124M4O4 systems are also collected in Table 4.",contradiction
Atomic radius of elements M from WebElements [37] are included in Table 4 for comparing the equilibrium volumes.,contradiction
Fig. 3 shows the formation energies as a function of relaxed volume of each of the 31 MO embedded iron systems.,contradiction
The formation energy of the oxides are related to their ability to resist the motion of dislocations in the iron matrix.,contradiction
Endothermic interaction between the oxide particles and the iron matrix is considered to keep the oxide particles undissolved in the iron matrix.,contradiction
Undissolved oxide particles are viewed to be more effective to pin dislocations [20].,contradiction
"We see from Fig. 3 that the oxides such as BaO, SrO, YO, CaO, SnO, CdO, ZrO, ScO, MgO, ZnO, SiO, AlO, MnO, and TaO with endothermic formation energies, are potential oxides to remain intact in the Fe matrix.",contradiction
"We see further that the oxides such as IrO, HfO, WO, NbO, RhO, ReO, MoO, OsO, TiO, CoO, VO, CrO, NiO, CuO, and FeO, are less stable in the iron matrix since their exothermic formation energies are manifestation of reaction between MO and Fe where exchange of M for Fe or nucleation of M-Fe-O oxide is favorable.",contradiction
The endothermic formation energy of MgO and the exothermic formation energy of TiO are similar to their interface energy with iron matrix [38].,contradiction
"We also find that some of these exothermic oxides such as HfO, WO, MoO and ReO remain intact though they are not observed experimentally.",contradiction
This is likely because the iron matrix enhances the M-O bonding in these oxides.,contradiction
"The other oxides such as NiO, NbO, TiO, VO, CoO, and CuO, which are observed experimentally, are calculated to have exothermic formation energies.",contradiction
"This may be because the transition metals Ni, Nb, Ti, V, Co, and Cu bond appreciably with the surrounding Fe as is evident from their intermetallic phases [25].",contradiction
"Elements such as Zr, Cd, Y, Sr and Ba have large endothermic formation energies in bcc iron [28] consequently their oxides (with endothermic formation energy) are highly stable in the iron matrix.",contradiction
"It may be noted that, in Table 4, HeO is listed to be endothermic though He and O atoms do not stay together as a cluster in the iron matrix.",contradiction
Thus the formation energy of HeO do not correspond to a single He4O4 entity embedded in the iron matrix rather corresponds to separate He and O atoms dissolved in the iron matrix which is endothermic perhaps because He assume apparently large size (as evident from the He-He bond length in iron matrix) which cause tensile stress on the matrix leading to increase in the total energy of Fe124He4O4.,contradiction
Thus the idea of endothermic formation energy (known as dissolution energy by Takahashi and Tanaka) for the stability of the embedded oxide against dissolution [20] is valid only if the oxide cluster remains intact.,contradiction
"For AuO also, the formation energy corresponds to Au and O atoms separately dissolved in the iron matrix rather than single Au4O4 units.",contradiction
"Therefore, HeO and AuO are omitted from the subsequent discussions.",contradiction
"But we would like to note that, in ODS steel under irradiation, O and He atoms are very likely to encounter each other.",contradiction
This work suggests that the tendency of O to trap He or vice versa is weak.,contradiction
"Another observation from Fig. 3 is that the formation energies exhibit a correlation with the radius of the M atoms (see Table 4) of the oxides when we consider BaO, SrO, YO, HfO, ZrO, TaO, CaO, NbO, WO, MoO, ScO, OsO, TiO, VO, and FeO.",contradiction
"Oxides such as MgO, SiO, MnO and IrO show appreciable deviation from this relation.",contradiction
We show later in Section 3.5 that the oxides that deviate from this correlation are those in which the hybridization between the valence orbitals of M and Fe are either weak or strong relative to those in other oxides.,contradiction
The bulk modulus is a measure of the ability of a substance to withstand changes in its volume by compression.,contradiction
The bulk modulus is related inversely to the thermal expansion coefficient of solids [39].,contradiction
Thus the bulk modulus of oxide embedded iron will be a useful indicator to identify the oxides for ODS steel that resist compression or expansion.,contradiction
"Moreover, DFT calculation of the bulk modulus of oxide embedded iron is rare though common for elemental and compound crystals [40,41].",contradiction
Therefore we computed the bulk modulus of all the 31 oxide embedded iron systems by fitting their E(V) data to the Vinet equation of state [34].,contradiction
"Table 4 lists the calculated equilibrium volumes, bulk moduli and their pressure derivatives for all the Fe124M4O4 systems.",contradiction
Fig. 4 shows the E(V) equation of state for all these systems.,contradiction
Smooth curves indicate that Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package gives E(V) for Fe124M4O4 systems in the same manner as it gives for elemental and compound crystals.,contradiction
"It is evident from Table 4 that the relaxed equilibrium volumes of all the systems, obtained by fitting the E(V) in Fig. 4, are increased with reference to pure Fe.",contradiction
"This increase in volume is generally from 3 to 5% except for CaO, SrO, BaO, YO, ZrO, HfO, CdO, and SnO embedded systems for them the increase is between 5 to 11%.",contradiction
Estimates of volumes of M4O4 from their respective atom sizes show that the increase in the volumes of the supercells are generally more than that contributed by M4O4 units.,contradiction
It is further evident from Table 4 that the bulk modulus of oxide embedded iron is generally reduced compared to the PAW-PBE bulk modulus of pure iron (185 GPa) [42].,entailment
This reduction in bulk modulus correlates with the increase in the equilibrium volumes of the oxide embedded iron as can be seen from Table 4 and Fig. 5 .,contradiction
"The reduction in bulk modulus of bcc iron due to the oxide particles appears to be in agreement with the reduction in bulk modulus and increase in lattice parameters of bcc iron with alloying elements Al, Si, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Rh [43] as well as with the reduction in bulk modulus of bcc iron with embedded A2B2O7 oxide particles [20].",contradiction
"We also see from Fig. 5 that the oxides such as CaO, SrO and BaO, with relatively higher contribution to equilibrium volumes, have reduced the bulk modulus of bcc iron appreciably.",contradiction
"The reduction in the bulk moduli of oxide embedded iron with the associated increase in the volumes compared to pure iron is further in accordance with the reduction in melting point and density of ODS steels compared to pure iron [37,44].",contradiction
"Compared to ScO embedded iron, the bulk modulus of WO embedded iron is appreciably higher though their volumes are comparable.",contradiction
"Correspondingly, it is found that the Fe-W bond lengths (2.32 A?) are shorter than Fe-Sc bond lengths (2.48 A?) indicating that the Fe-W bonding is relatively strong.",contradiction
Fig. 6 plots the calculated formation energies of the oxides in bcc iron and the bulk moduli of the oxide embedded bcc iron.,contradiction
ODS steels with higher bulk moduli and endothermic formation energies for the oxide particles are considered to be able to resist thermal expansion and stop dislocation motion leading to stable microstructure at elevated temperatures [20].,contradiction
"In this connection, Fig. 6 indicates that ZrO, AlO, SiO, MnO, and TaO have endothermic formation energies with relatively higher bulk moduli for respective oxide embedded bcc iron, making them suitable candidates as dispersions in ODS iron alloys.",contradiction
"It is also evident that oxides such as, YO, CdO, SnO, MgO, ZnO, and ScO constitute stable oxides in the iron matrix though they cause a reduction of the bulk modulus.",contradiction
"The other oxides, such as, TiO, VO, CrO, FeO, CoO, NiO, MoO, RhO, HfO, WO, ReO, OsO, and IrO, retain or enhance the bulk modulus of the iron matrix, but their exothermic formation energies indicate that they are chemically less stable.",contradiction
This work thus show that TiO stays intact in the bcc iron matrix but it is not the most stable oxide.,contradiction
Fig. 6 further shows that the formation energies of the oxide particles have a correlation with the bulk modulus of the respective oxide embedded iron.,contradiction
"We also see that CaO, SrO, and BaO are quite stable against dissolution, but they cause considerable reduction of bulk modulus of the iron matrix.",contradiction
It is evident that most of the oxides predicted to be stable in the iron matrix (except AlO and TaO) are observed experimentally (see Table 1).,contradiction
"Whereas, many of the oxides which are unstable in the iron matrix are not observed experimentally (AuO, CrO, HfO, IrO, MoO, OsO, ReO, RhO, WO.",contradiction
It is noted here that Hf-O precipitates with Hf:O ratio close to 1 has been reported in Fe14Cr0.22Hf alloy fabricated by spark plasma sintering [45]).,contradiction
"Inspection of Iron-binary phase diagrams [25] show further that the majority of the M's of the exothermic MO oxides (Ir, Rh, Ni, Co, Cr, V, Mo, Nb, and Re) form extended solid solution with Fe unlike M's of endothermic oxides (Ca, Sr, Ba, Y, Cd, Sn, Mg, Sc, Zr, Mn and Ta).",contradiction
"We have seen that the oxides with endothermic formation energies, which tend to retain the bulk modulus of the iron matrix, are potential candidates for the development of improved ODS steels.",contradiction
Comparison of our bulk moduli of the MO embedded iron with those of the A2B2O7 embedded iron by Takahashi and Tanaka [20] indicates that the MO oxides are better candidates to retain/improve the bulk modulus of the iron matrix.,contradiction
"Thus the MO oxides, such as, SnO, MgO, YO, CdO, ScO, ZrO, AlO, SiO, MnO, TaO, and ZnO, are predicted to be suitable candidates to be investigated as dispersion in ferritic matrix.",contradiction
"We note that, among these oxides, MgO has been already studied as an alternative dispersion in ODS steels [13,14].",contradiction
Stability of the oxide dispersion against dissolution is important for the reliable long-term performance of the ODS steel core components.,contradiction
"Therefore, the stability of the oxide dispersion and the associated properties of ODS steels have been studied actively.",contradiction
"For the oxide nanoparticles, various compositions and structures have been discussed in the literature.",contradiction
B1-type TiO nanoparticles have been observed in certain ODS steel.,contradiction
The B1-type oxide is considered to have great chemical flexibility [9].,contradiction
"To improve our understanding on the structure and stability of the B1-type oxides as dispersions in ODS ferritic steel, we carried out calculations of formation energies of 31 different oxides in bcc iron matrix and their bulk moduli using DFT calculations.",contradiction
The calculations were performed with Fe124M4O4 systems modeled on 4ž4ž4 bcc supercells.,contradiction
Analysis of the relaxed structures from our work show that many of the oxides embedded in the iron matrix remain structurally intact with some amount of distortion from the cubic form.,contradiction
Formation energies of these oxides show a correlation with the equilibrium volumes of the oxide embedded iron.,contradiction
Bulk moduli of the oxide embedded iron show an inverse correlation with their equilibrium volumes.,contradiction
"Further, the formation energies of the oxides in the iron matrix exhibit an inverse correlation with the bulk moduli of the oxide embedded iron.",contradiction
The degree of hybridization between the valence states of M and the surrounding Fe atoms is found to be the mechanism for the endothermic or exothermic formation energies of the oxides in the iron matrix.,contradiction
"That is, the M's with exothermic formation energy for MO, such as NiO, RhO and IrO, exhibit strong hybridization of their d density of states with the Fe d density of states while the M's with endothermic formation energy for MO, such as MgO, YO and ZrO, exhibit weak overlap with the Fe density of states.",contradiction
Endothermic formation energy is related to the resistance of the oxide particle against dissolution into constituent atoms.,contradiction
Oxide embedded iron with relatively higher bulk moduli are considered to resist dislocation motion and thermal expansion better.,contradiction
"Our work predicts that oxides, namely YO, CdO, SnO, MgO, ScO, ZrO, SiO, AlO, MnO, TaO and ZnO, with endothermic formation energy in the iron matrix combined with better bulk moduli, have the potential to improve the properties ODS steels.",contradiction
This work also indicates that B1-tye MO oxides retain/improve the bulk modulus of iron matrix better compared to A2B2O7 pyrochlore-type oxides.,contradiction
MgO has been already studied as an alternative dispersion in ODS steels.,contradiction
"AlO, CrO, MoO, TaO, WO and ReO dispersions are predicted to enhance the bulk moduli of the iron matrix and remain structurally intact though they are not observed experimentally.",contradiction
This indicates that the iron matrix confine these oxides to remain intact.,contradiction
Rare-earth orthoborates exhibit useful luminescent properties when doped with lanthanide ions.,contradiction
They demonstrate a strong chemical stability and optical damage resistance making them desirable for optics applications [1?6].,contradiction
"The luminescent properties, such as intensity and chromaticity, can be tuned via the external control parameters of pressure [7].",contradiction
"A natural extension of such high pressure studies is to investigate the isothermal pressure-volume compressibility, or its inverse, the fundamental thermodynamic parameter of the isothermal bulk modulus.",contradiction
The primary objective of this work is to clarify the bulk modulus of GdBO3 by performing high pressure powder X-ray diffraction on nanocrystal samples.,contradiction
YBO3 nanocrystals were also investigated for comparison.,contradiction
"Certainly, single crystal diffraction measurements would have facilitated the refinement of atomic positions, however the structure of the GdBO3 and YBO3 orthoborates is already well known [8?10].",contradiction
"For the purpose of determining lattice parameters as a function of pressure, and subsequently the isothermal bulk modulus, powder XRD measurements at high pressure are more than suitable.",contradiction
"The choice of nano-crystalline samples offers a route to optimise the polycrystallinity of the sample (see Supplementary Fig. 1) without affecting the observed compressional behaviour, as discussed below.",contradiction
"(N.B.: When no ?nano-? or ?micro-? prefix is stated, the article refers to the nanocrystal samples which are the focus of this work.).",contradiction
The bulk modulus of a material is a fundamental thermodynamic parameter.,contradiction
"The secondary objective of this paper is, more generally, to draw attention to the fact that the accurate and reliable determination of compressibility values requires careful data acquisition and analysis which is not always performed.",contradiction
"Recently, the bulk modulus of GdBO3 was reported by Woz?ny et al. in Ref. [11] to be 326 GPa, which the authors allege supports the earlier reported value of 321 GPa by Wang et al. in Ref. [12].",entailment
"In our previous work, Ref. [13], we commented on the reliability of the bulk modulus alleged in Ref. [12] pertaining to the isomorphic borate YBO3, and the reader is referred there for more details.",contradiction
"The focus of the current article is the reported bulk moduli of GdBO3, although nanocrystal YBO3 samples were investigated in parallel for comparison.",contradiction
"The experimental results of Ref. [12] pertaining to GdBO3 attracted close criticism from Ref. [14], which provided ab initio calculations and arguments based on the systematics of isomorphic borates to suggest that the actual isothermal bulk modulus of GdBO3 is in fact closer to 135 GPa.",entailment
"In this work, through careful data acquisition and analysis, whereby non-hydrostatic data are identified and disregarded, the bulk modulus of GdBO3 was determined to be 170(13) GPa, which is in good agreement expected values based on compressibility systematics of orthoborates and with the predicted value of 135 GPa of Ref. [14], and is approximately 50% of the overestimated value of 326 GPa of Ref. [11], and of 321 of Ref. [12].",entailment
GdBO3 and YBO3 nanocrystals were loaded into membrane-driven diamond anvil cells (DACs) to achieve gigapascal (GPa) pressures.,contradiction
Pure Cu powder was included in an isolated sample area for use as a pressure gauge in the XRD experiments [15].,contradiction
"Tungsten gaskets were pre-indented to 30 ?m prior to loading the nanocrystals, and diamond anvils with culet sizes ~300 ?m were used.",contradiction

Refinement of the calculated Le Bail profiles against the observed data was performed in JANA2006 [19].,contradiction

"Equations of state (EOS) were fitted to the volume-pressure data using EOSFit7 [20] using second-order (B0 ? = 4) Birch-Murnaghan equations [21], the validity of which was checked via the gradient of associated F E vs. f E plots [22] provided in the Supplementary Material.",contradiction

"The average particle size, according to Ref. [8], is 350 nm.",contradiction
"Therefore, the average grain size must be between 30 and 350 nm.",contradiction
Two important points must be made before commencing with the following discussion.,contradiction
"Firstly, we are able to make a direct comparison between the compressional properties of GdBO3 of this work, and the GdBO3:Eu3+ of Ref. [11] because eightfold-coordinated Gd3+ and Eu3+ ions have very similar ionic radii of 1.053 and 1.066 A?, respectively, according Ref. [25].",contradiction
"Therefore, the bulk moduli of GdBO3 and GdBO3:Eu3+ can be expected to be essentially identical.",contradiction
"Secondly, we are also able to make a direct comparison between powder samples consisting of nano-crystals and micro-crystals.",contradiction

"The data of Wang et al., shown in blue, are well described by their alleged equations of state, however for reasons previously discussed (see Ref. [13]) their bulk moduli for YBO3 and GdBO3 are likely to be an overestimation by a factor of approximately 2.",contradiction
"The data of Woz?ny et al., shown in red, have here been refitted with a bulk modulus of 95(13) GPa.",entailment
"There are three important remarks: firstly that the alleged GdBO3 bulk modulus of 326 GPa is not compatible with their data; secondly, that in any case such a large bulk modulus is not compatible with the known compressibility systematics of isomorphic borates [26]; and thirdly, that the low bulk modulus of 95(13) GPa re-fitted here drastically underestimates the bulk modulus of GdBO3.",entailment
"Therefore, the data of Woz?ny et al. do not agree with those of Ref. [12] (shown in blue) as they claim.",contradiction
"Their result is potentially the product of problems either with their experimental data or the analysis thereof, however it is not possible to say based on the data they present, for example: not a single a XRD refinement is presented and only integrated patterns are provided; no details are provided of how the XRD fits were made; no details are provided of how the equations of state were fitted, such as the type or order; the XRD patterns exhibit gasket reflections from the very lowest pressure; and, the XRD reflections are broad/exhibit low-intensity at low pressures (compare for example to the data in Fig. 1).",contradiction
"For their XRD experiments Daphne 7575 oil was used, which has a hydrostatic limit at ambient temperature of ~ 4 GPa, so it is not clear why the XRD peaks are so broad at low pressure, although it is possible that the sample chamber was too densely packed to allow room for sufficient PTM, therefore leading to bridging of the sample between diamonds.",contradiction
"Regarding the triclinic GdBO3 phase reported on by Woz?ny et al., we cannot recreate the equation of state shown in their Fig. 2(c).",contradiction
"Numerous different equation of state have been fitted to their data using their reported values of V 0 = 230:77 A? and B 0 = 27:09 GPa as fixed parameters, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 7, however we were not able to reproduce the reported EOS.",entailment
"Relaxing the fixed parameters results in converged fit with a very low bulk modulus of 19(3) GPa, which describes the data very closely but still raises concerns.",entailment
"For example, a bulk modulus of 19(3) GPa would suggest that the triclinic GdBO3 compound is as compressible as a rare-gas solid, which cannot be the case.",entailment
This points to unexplained experimental errors which have led to underestimations in both monoclinic and triclinic GdBO3 bulk moduli.,contradiction
The essential difference between the triclinic and monoclinic GdBO3 phases is that the BO4-tetrahedra in the monoclinic phase open to up form triangular BO3-units in the triclinic phase.,contradiction
"Therefore, although a lower bulk modulus is indeed expected for the triclinic phase, the fact that the triclinic structure contains GdO8-octahedra and BO3-trigonal-units certainly indicates a compound more rigid than a rare-gas solid.",contradiction

"Additionally, these orthoborates in fact appear to be pseudo-wollastonites rather than the commonly referenced ?psuedo-vaterites? [10].",contradiction
The lowest pressure GdBO3 XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) indicated trace amounts of a triclinic GdBO3 phase which were detected via extremely low-intensity low-angle reflections (marked with red asterisks).,contradiction
The triclinic GdBO3 phase is well documented in Ref. [8].,contradiction
The trace impurity was not detectable using in-house XRD techniques and it is present in such small amount that it does not affect subsequent compressional data analysis of the pure monoclinic phase.,contradiction
"Indeed, the reflections from the triclinic GdBO3 phase are not observable at higher pressures even with the high-sensitivity of synchrotron XRD.",contradiction
The integrated XRD patterns for GdBO3 and YBO3 shown in Fig. 1 are of the lowest and highest pressures observed within the quasihydrostatic pressure range.,contradiction
The onset of non-hydrostaticity in the GdBO3 and YBO3 samples was identified by observing the evolution of the full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the 002 reflection with increasing pressure (shown in Supplementary Fig. 3).,contradiction
"The clear discontinuity in the rate of change of FWHM at 6.5 GPa for YBO3 and 9 GPa for GdBO3 indicate the loss of quasihydrostaticity and all data above these pressures have been omitted from further analysis, although they are still included in Fig. 2(a) to illustrate that the onset of non-hydrostaticity is also observed in the calculated unit cell volumes as a function of pressure.",contradiction

The F E vs. f E plots provided Supplementary Fig. 6 provide a useful visual assessment of the quality of the fitted equations of state.,contradiction
The excellent suitability of the second-order EOS truncation is demonstrated via the essentially zero gradient in those plots.,contradiction
The reader is referred to Ref. [22] for more details regarding F E vs. f E plots.,contradiction
"In addition to the bulk modulus of GdBO3, we also calculated for the first time the individual axial compressibilities via the isothermal compressibility tensor [24] (see Supplementary Table 3) which reveals an anisotropic compressibility in GdBO3 essentially identical to that exhibited by YBO3 in our previous work [13] and which we rationalised in terms of the compressibilities of the constituent BO4-tetrahedra and AO8-dodecahedra.",contradiction
"We note that the anisotropic compressibility is compatible with the constraint of the EOS to second-order (B 0 ? = 4) because the physical meaning of the constraint is only that, to a first approximation, the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus is constant.",contradiction
"This experimental X-ray diffraction study of GdBO3 and YBO3 nanocrystals under compression, up to 17.4(2) and 13.4(2) GPa respectively, has provided an accurate revision of the compressional behaviour of monoclinic GdBO3.",contradiction
"In particular, the fundamental property of bulk modulus was found to be 170(13) and 163(13) GPa for GdBO3 and YBO3 nanocrystals respectively, thereby revealing that the compressional behaviour of both compounds is consistent with the family of borate compounds.",entailment
"The ab initio calculations of Ref. [14] predicted a GdBO3 bulk modulus of 135 GPa, which consistent with the results presented here, and those expected based on observed compression systematics based on metallic cationic radius [26].",entailment
"The previously alleged bulk moduli [11,12] suggested that GdBO3 would be less compressible than all known ultra-incompressible nitride and carbides [28] which is not expected for such a layered structure [29].",contradiction
"This study concludes that the claims of GdBO3 incompressibility made by other authors are not correct, in particular that the GdBO3 bulk modulus values of 326 GPa reported in Ref. [11], and of 321 GPa in Ref. [12], are overestimated by a factor of approximately 2.",entailment
"In this work, comparison of the compressional behaviour of GdBO3 with structurally analogous YBO3 provides very similar results for both compounds as expected.",contradiction
"The YBO3 bulk modulus determined here (163(13) GPa) agrees very closely with our previous result [13] on YBO3 micro-powders of 164(8) GPa, and shows that in the case of these rare-earth orthoborates optimisation of powder XRD experiments is possible through the use of nano-powder samples without affecting the observed compressional behaviours.",entailment

"Due to the largely ionically bonded nature of HAP, coulombic repulsion is believed to be the main cause of failure in compression.",contradiction
This mechanism is further discussed below.,contradiction
"In uniaxial X compression, the observed loss in elastic modulus and subsequent re-strengthening of the material prior to the inception of failure was found to be due to angular rotation and re-alignment between the shorter Ca(II)?O(III) bond species positioned along the X axis.",contradiction
It is believed that the temporary loss of bond alignment along the X-axis is responsible for the accompanying decrease in the elastic modulus.,contradiction
This effect was observed to be global.,contradiction
Figs. 9 and 10 show the progression of realignment of these groups prior to the inception of failure.,contradiction
"The inception of failure, at a strain of 0.135, for compression loading in the X direction was found to be associated with tensile strain induced in Ca(I)?O(III) bonds as compressive strain caused rotation of neighboring phosphate groups.",contradiction
Phosphate group rotation caused the Ca(I) column between three neighboring phosphates to divide into two sections.,contradiction
This dissociation did not show calcium atoms shifting with the rotating phosphate group in question as they shifted with the other two phosphate groups.,contradiction
"As a result, likely fracture of the ionic Ca(I)?O(III) bond with the rotated phosphate was observed, signaling material failure.",contradiction
Fig. 11 illustrates this mechanism.,contradiction
The inception of failure in the crystal when compressed in Y direction was found to be global.,contradiction
Increased atomic shear strain was observed on the Ca(II)?O(II) bond groups with Y-axis bond orientation throughout loading.,contradiction
Material failure was attributed to failure of these groups.,contradiction
"The atomic snapshots at the progressive compressive strains in these groups leading to, at, and after the inception of failure are shown in Fig. 12 .",contradiction
"Upon application of compressive strain in the Y direction, the shift of Ca(II) atoms which have Y-oriented Ca(II)?O(II) bonds is apparent (see Fig. 13 ).",contradiction
These bonds are driven most directly in the direction of the compressive load due to their orientation but do not break prior to global failure.,contradiction
"This causes the attached phosphate groups to rotate into the nearest neighbor phosphate groups, resulting in coulombic repulsion between oxygen atoms and sudden global failure.",contradiction
"Under applied uniaxial Z compressive loading, monocrystalline HAP exhibits relatively uniform atomic shear strain globally.",contradiction
The small decrease in the stiffness after a strain of 0.06 was observed to be followed by a slow increase prior to the inception of failure.,contradiction
"Since no significant Poisson effect resulting in planar X?Y bond deformation was observed, the deformation behavior of the crystal can be attributed only to bonds with significant Z orientation in this case.",contradiction
The change in stiffness is attributed to a significant change in angle of the shorter Ca(II)?O(III) bond species from the strain of 6.5% up to the strain at the peak point of 0.22 (see Fig. 14 ).,contradiction
"These are the species that are most aligned with the Z axis, so increasing misalignment along Z-axis was believed to soften the global response to applied strain.",contradiction
"Furthermore, large reduction in the bond angle was observed globally in Ca(I)?O(I) and Ca(I)?O(II) bond species (see Figs. 15 and 16 ).",contradiction
"The stiffening just before the inception of the failure is due to slowly increasing coulombic repulsion as bond species end groups of similar charge, i.e. O and Ca ions, are forced closer together.",contradiction
"Worth noting is that the end-to-end distance of the longer Ca(II)?O(III) bond groups did not change appreciably before failure, although the observed change in vector azimuthal angle throughout deformation seems to indicate some end group twisting during deformation (see Fig. 17 ).",contradiction
This twisting behavior as opposed to outright angle closure and end group distance reduction may be due to the fact that the longer Ca(II)?O(III) bonds have the least direct Z orientation at equilibrium among the studied groups.,contradiction
"When viewed as a bulk crystal, the continued flattening of oxygen groups between planes of phosphorus atoms is visible until delocalized fracture occurs throughout the crystal.",contradiction
These oxygen groups appear to flatten as the polyhedra undergo angular changes at their vertices due to the applied Z compressive strain.,contradiction
"Fig. 18 a-c show the YZ views of the HAP crystal at zero strain, just prior to the inception of failure, and following the failure, respectively.",contradiction
"Both Figs. 3 and 8 show significant anisotropy with regards to stiffness, fracture (failure) strain, and fracture (failure) strength of a HAP single crystal between the basal (normal to Z direction) and side planes.",contradiction
"This trend is in a good agreement with the ab-initio calculations of tensile loading (Ching et al., 2009) and the nanoindentation experiments (Saber-Samandari and Gross, 2009; Viswanath et al., 2007; Zamiri and De, 2011) on HAP single crystals.",contradiction
"Comparing Figs. 3 and 8, one can also observe a significant compression/tension asymmetry in all loading directions.",contradiction
"In both tension and compression, the elastic modulus is highest in the Z direction, i.e. normal to the basal plane.",contradiction
"However, the lowest fracture strength and strain values for the crystal in tension are in the Z direction, with the opposite being true for compression.",contradiction
This asymmetry can be best explained by considering that a large number of bonds throughout the crystal are oriented at least partially along the Z axis.,contradiction
"Therefore, a large number of bonds participate in the constitutive behavior of the crystal when it is loaded in the Z direction.",contradiction
This gives the Z direction a higher stiffness than X or Y for either tensile or compression loadings.,contradiction
"Because bond stretching and breakage is the cause of tensile failure and coulombic repulsion is the cause of compressive failure, the large number of bonds with Z orientation contribute heavily in both cases.",contradiction
Bonds that are significantly oriented with the Z axis stretch the most quickly under tensile loading but do not have like-charged species getting in close proximity with each other in compression until the bond is reduced sufficiently from the initial angle.,contradiction
"This results in a much larger failure strain in Z direction when the model is under compression, i.e. 0.22 in comparison against 0.08 in tension.",contradiction
"Experimental data for uniaxial loading on HAP single crystals are lacking, however, the observed trend is in good agreement with the common behavior of ceramics, i.e. lower failure strains under tension.",contradiction
"Fig. 3 shows the stress-strain curves for uniaxial tension along the X, Y, and Z axes at a strain rate of 1e10 /s and a temperature of 10 K.",contradiction
"The elastic modulus is highest in the Z direction (Ez=160GPa) and similar for X and Y (Ex=116GPa, Ey=117GPa).",contradiction
"However, the fracture strength and strain are both highest in the Y direction and lowest in the Z direction.",contradiction
"For both the X and Y directions, the peak strain is larger than the strain where the constitutive response is changed, i.e. 6.5%.",contradiction
"In contrast, the stress quickly drops for the Z direction at a strain of 8.5%, indicating a very low degree of plasticity in this direction.",contradiction
"The observed mechanical behavior of HAP single crystals in this work is in good agreement with the results of an ab-initio study detailing the mechanical behavior of a HAP single crystal under tensile loading (Ching et al., 2009).",contradiction
"Ductile behavior was observed when the single crystal was loaded in the X and Y directions, with a yield strain of ~8%.",contradiction
"However, the HAP single crystal showed brittle behavior under uniaxial Z tension (normal to the basal plane), as the stress dropped significantly after the following peak stress at a strain of ~10%.",contradiction
"Differences between the reported values in this work and the aforementioned study by Ching et al. could be due to different methods of solving (ab-initio vs molecular dynamics) and different model sizes (100s of atoms for ab-initio vs thousands of atoms for MD), with both having significant effect on the calculated strain and stress values.",contradiction
"The overall mechanical behavior of monocrystalline HAP subjected to deformation can be viewed as a reflection of the behavior of individual bond types that comprise the crystal, since no defects or surface conditions are present.",contradiction
"Given this assertion, the cohesiveness and shape of certain bond groups and overall bond lengths of each bond type were observed during loading.",contradiction
"OVITO was used to measure bond lengths and observe discrete particle behavior directly (Stukowski, 2010).",contradiction
"Cohesiveness and shape refer to initial polyhedral arrangement and order, including allowances for the effect of bond lengthening under load.",contradiction
The bond length considered the limit above which breakage occurred was equal to the initial bond length multiplied by one plus the failure strain of the crystal for the respective uniaxial loading being simulated.,contradiction
"This is viewed as a conservative approximation of bond breakage, since all bond types present contribute to the cumulative failure strain in a crystal.",contradiction
"Given that ionic bonds do not rely on direct electron sharing, ionic interactions can persist beyond the range that covalent bonds can stretch to before failure.",contradiction
"Thus, ionic bonds are suspected to contribute to the majority of strain at failure in the HAP crystal.",contradiction
"The initial bond lengths in HAP were taken from Posner et al. (1958), as shown in Table 3 .",contradiction
"To explain the observed tensile behavior in Fig. 3, we intend to investigate the underlying deformation mechanisms for each load case.",contradiction
"Nanoscale deformation mechanisms associated with uniaxial X tension were found to include directionally-dependent bond breakage, where bonds aligned with the loading direction were found to break.",contradiction
Initial fracture was observed to be local to Ca(II) hexahedral arrangements surrounding hydroxide columns.,contradiction
"Following the inception of plasticity at 6.5% strain, breakage of ionic Ca(I)?O(III) and Ca(II)?O(I) groups was observed prior to global crystal failure.",contradiction
"Bond breakage and group deformation were observed for ionically bonded Ca(I)?O(I), Ca(I)?O(III), Ca(II)?OH, Ca(II)?O(I), and the shorter of the two Ca(II)?O(III) bond species (see Fig. 2).",contradiction
"Fig. 4 shows the breakage observed in these bond groups in a given fracture zone at 15.5% strain, i.e. the strain at the highest stress.",contradiction
"Among the involved bond types, Ca(II)?OH contributes the most to the deformation at the fracture zone as shown in Fig. 4.",contradiction
"In uniaxial Y tension, bond breakage and group deformation were observed in ionic Ca(I)?O(I), Ca(I)?O(III), Ca(II)?O(I), and Ca(II)?O(II) bonds (see Fig. 2).",contradiction
Fig. 5 shows the deformation in these bond groups.,contradiction
The superior mechanical properties compared to uniaxial X tension despite similar deformation mechanisms are postulated to be due to the maintenance of Ca(II)?OH bonds.,contradiction
These allow for the hexagonal arrangement of Ca(II) atoms to maintain position around the hydroxyl columns until large scale planar Ca(II)?O(II) bond fracture occurs.,contradiction
"Fig. 6 a-h shows the atomic snapshots of a sample Ca(II)?OH column selected in the shear zone at the peak points and at about 2.5% strain after the peak points for uniaxial tension in X and Y directions, respectively.",contradiction
Fig. 7 shows the deformation mechanisms including the breakage and shape loss for various bonds when the model was subjected to uniaxial Z strain.,contradiction
"Consistent with tensile loading in the X and Y directions, no covalent bond group breakage or loss of shape was observed in uniaxial tension along the Z direction.",contradiction
"The inception of failure for Z-direction uniaxial tension is not accompanied by the fracture of any bond groups with X?Y planar character, i.e. Ca(II)?O(I), Ca(II)?O(II), Ca(II)?OH, and Ca(I)?O(III) bonds; instead it is marked by fracture of the Ca(I)?O(II) groups and both variants of the Ca(II)?O(III) group.",contradiction
"This is consistent with the directional bond breakage observed for X and Y uniaxial tension, since the named bond groups are highly aligned with the Z axis.",contradiction
"The bond breakage described in all tensile loading directions was antedated by the concomitant rotation of the phosphate groups to which the Ca?O bonds are attached, which agrees with the ab initio findings of Ching et al. (2009).",contradiction
Nanoscale deformation mechanisms in bulk stoichiometric hexagonal hydroxyapatite were studied using molecular dynamics simulations in LAMMPS.,contradiction
Both uniaxial tension and compression were considered.,contradiction
Different behavior in HAP single crystals between tension and compression is directly attributable to directionally dependent nanoscale deformation mechanisms.,contradiction
"In tension, failure of ionic bonds groups due to applied strain caused crystal failure in each loading case.",contradiction
"Primary X direction tensile failure was associated with breakage of ionic Ca(I)?O(I), Ca(I)?O(III), Ca(II)?OH, Ca(II)?O(I), and the shorter of the two Ca(II)?O(III) bond species.",contradiction
"Y tensile failure was associated with bond breakage in ionic Ca(I)?O(I), Ca(I)?O(III), Ca(II)?O(I), and Ca(II)?O(II) bonds.",contradiction
Z tensile failure was marked by the breakage of the Ca(I)?O(II) groups and both variants of the Ca(II)?O(III) group.,contradiction
"The elastic tensile modulus for Z was highest, followed by Y and X.",contradiction
"In compression, coulombic repulsion between ionic groups of similar charge ultimately caused crystal failure in every loading case, although preceding bond behavior varied.",contradiction
"In X uniaxial compression, failure was caused by the tensile strain induced in Ca(I)?O(III) bonds as compressive strain caused rotation of neighboring phosphate groups.",contradiction
Failure in Y uniaxial compression was attributed to breaking of Ca(II)?O(II) bond groups with Y direction bond orientation.,contradiction
"Z uniaxial compressive failure was linked to coulombic repulsion as Ca(I)?O(I), Ca(I)?O(II), and shorter Ca(II)?O(III) groups experienced high bond angle reduction and decreasing distance between like-charge end groups.",contradiction
"The elastic modulus in compression was highest for Z, followed by Y and X.",contradiction
The asymmetries seen between uniaxial tension and compression were most disparate for the applied strain in the Z direction as opposed to X and Y.,contradiction
This is largely due to the aforementioned failure mechanisms in each case.,contradiction
"Bonds with high Z orientation at equilibrium were found to undergo low strain to failure in tension, but significant strain in compression due to the opportunity for large bond angle reduction prior to repulsive failure.",contradiction
"In the current era of advancement in information technology, our main focus is on the development of high speed and efficient data processing devices in the field of photonics.",contradiction
"For such devices, the non-linear optical crystals are highly demanded by researchers and technologists due to their potential applications in photonics such as optical switches, optical modulators, frequency multipliers, electro-optical devices etc [1?5].",contradiction
"The materials useful for NLO applications must be able to change the amplitude, frequency, intensity, pulse width, phase and polarization of the incident laser field up to a maximum extent.",contradiction
This change in such properties is one of the most important factors for suitability of a crystal in a particular device fabrication.,contradiction
Thus there is need of such an optical material which could be easily grown in the form of single crystal as well as possess excellent non linear optical behavior.,contradiction
"The amino acid based single crystals have been found most suitable candidates due to their attractive NLO properties [5,6].",contradiction
As the structure of amino acids can be changed to a desirable extent by molecular engineering and chemical synthesis.,contradiction
Therefore large structural diversity of amino acids is highly helpful in modification of the material properties.,contradiction
l-ornithine monohydrochloride (LOMHCl) belongs to amino acid family and has been reported as one of the potential NLO crystal with 1.7 times more SHG than KDP [7?9].,contradiction
It crystallizes in monoclinic crystal system with space group P1211.,contradiction
"Many investigators reported the growth and various structural, optical and thermal properties of the title compound [7?9].",contradiction
"However, so many other useful properties needed for device fabrication have not been reported so far.",contradiction
"To the best of our knowledge this is the first report which carries, the mechanical, thermal, photo acoustic, surface morphology and HETCOR analysis of LOMHCl single crystal.",contradiction
The single crystals of the title compound have been grown by slow evaporation solution technique with the help of controlled temperature bath at constant temperature of 35ø C.,contradiction
"The optically transparent, larger size and good quality single crystals were harvested in a span of 16 days.",contradiction
The grown single crystal of size 15 ž 12 ž 5 mm3 is shown in Fig. 1 .,contradiction
The grown crystals were cut and polished before subjecting to various characterization analyses.,contradiction
Surface morphology of the grown crystal was studied using SEM analysis.,contradiction
"The surface monographs were recorded at different magnification such as ž100, ž500, ž1000 and ž1500 times as shown below in Fig. 13 (a), (b), (c) and (d) respectively.",contradiction
From Fig. 12 (a) it is clear that the surface consist of regular repetition of needle like shape with small kinks on the surface at lower resolution.,contradiction
With the increase in resolution similar type of parallel and highly ordered needles like shape with increased surface area were seen without any significant changein the repetition pattern that indicates the crystalline nature of the sample.,contradiction
The crystal perfection of the grown crystal was examined by HRXRD.,contradiction
The rocking curve for a grown LOMHCl crystal using (011) diffracting plane in symmetrical Bragg's geometry with CuK?1 radiations was recorded as shown in Fig. 2 .,contradiction
It is clear from the figure that diffraction curve contains only single peak having full width at half maximum (FWHM) equal to 48 arc sec.,contradiction
It reveals that the specimen is free from structural grain boundaries.,contradiction
"However, FWHM equal to 48 arc sec is slightly greater than the expected value from the plane wave theory of dynamical X-ray diffraction [17].",contradiction
The diffraction curve (DC) is asymmetric on both side of Bragg peak (taken at zero).,contradiction
This asymmetry is due to difference in the scattered intensity on both side of peak because of presence of point defects and their agglomerates [18].,contradiction
"On careful observation of the DC, one can easily see that the scattered intensity is more in negative side as compared to positive side.",contradiction
This feature clearly indicates that the crystal contains the vacancy defects instead of interstitial type defect.,contradiction
"This can be easily understood that due to tensile stress, lattice parameter d increases and leads to give more scattered intensity at slightly lower value of Bragg's angle (?B) because d and sin ?B are inversely proportional (2d sin? = n?) to each other.",contradiction
"However in the present study, diffraction curve contains only single peak that indicate the absence of clustering of point defects at microscopic level.",contradiction
Further single peak with a reasonably low FWHM indicates that crystalline perfection and quality of the grown crystal are fairly better as compared with the earlier reports [7].,contradiction
"For the photonic device application, a crystal should possess not only better optical properties like SHG and LDT but also it should withstand good mechanical stability.",contradiction
This is the main parameter while making the device fabrication.,contradiction
"Resistance to laser damage of the grown crystal depends highly upon its mechanical stability which can be accessed in terms of hardness, stiffness coefficient etc.",contradiction
Nanoindentation is an excellent technique for investigating the mechanical property of the material thoroughly.,contradiction
The load displacement curves corresponding to different loads were plotted and it is shown in Fig. 3 .,contradiction
From the figure we can see that peak depth at maximum load is ?2725 nm which revealed that LOMHCl crystal is softer than quartz and sapphire crystal [12] and harder than L-threoninium picrate crystal [19].,contradiction
This may be explained due to its organic nature and layered structure of the material.,contradiction
"Hence, grown crystals possess larger mechanical stability as compared to some other NLO crystals.",contradiction
"Further on careful observation of all these load displacement curves, some pop-in(s) may be seen in the loading curve at lower loads equal to 75 mN.",contradiction
The appearance of pop-in(s) is due to breaking of molecular interlayer that allows the penetration of indenter in the crystal suddenly.,contradiction
The visibility of the pop-in(s) increases with the increase in applied load.,contradiction
"In Fig. 3, appearance of various pop-in(s) for higher load indicates the nucleation of plastic deformation due to the presence of slip and cracks like defect in the crystal [20,21].",contradiction
"From the HRXRD result vacancy type point defects were confirmed, this also causes plastic deformation in the crystal.",contradiction
The pop-in density is increasing with increase in load which indicates the presence of cracks due to higher strain produced by Berkovich tip.,contradiction
This may occur because of higher strain offered by sharp Berkovich tip that causes sliding of layers.,contradiction
"As different layers are bounded by weak van der wall forces thus leading to occurrence of cracks in the crystal, which can also be seen from the optical image of the crystal after indentation as shown in Fig. 4 .",contradiction
"Furthermore, nanoindentation depth profile and profile obtained from AFM image at higher loads have a good correlation as shown in Fig. 5 .",contradiction
With the help of load displacement curves various parameters were evaluated as given in Table 1 .,contradiction
From the table we can clearly see that hardness and Young's modulus decreases with increase in load due to indentation size effect [19].,contradiction
Further load independent hardness (H0) was calculated by using H0 = ka2 where k is constant whose value depends on geometry of indenter (in present case k = 1/24.5) and a2 is obtained by polynomial fitting of load versus contact depth curve.,contradiction
"From the polynomial fit curve, the value of a2 is 2.0931 ž 10?5.",contradiction
The value of hardness H0 for the crystal LOMHCl is found equal to 854.32 MPa.,contradiction
"However, this value is found much larger than Bi2Te3 and L-threoniuium picrate single crystals [19,22].",contradiction
"Moreover, from the curve of load versus contact depth, contact depth increases with increase in load due to decrease in hardness number.",contradiction
"In addition to this, stiffness versus contact depth was plotted and linearly fitted as shown in Fig. 8 .",contradiction
"The observed relation is found similar to a straight line equation S = a+bhc, where b is slop of straight line and it is the reduced Young's modulus and its value for the title compound is obtained 126.42 GPa.",contradiction
The intercept denoted by ?a? is found equal to 0.0293 which is due to indenter tip rounding.,contradiction
Fig. 7 shows the plot between Young's modulus and load.,contradiction
It is observed that Young's modulus decreases with increase in load which is due to increase in strain in crystal.,contradiction
From the above said discussion we may conclude that the crystal is having moderate mechanical stability at room temperature (see Fig. 6).,contradiction
The grown single crystal was taken and then it was crushed by using an agate morter.,contradiction
The finely powdered specimen was used to record the DSC (Perkin Elmer made DSC 4000) spectrum and the recorded spectrum is shown in Fig. 9 .,contradiction
The sample was heated from room temperature i.e. 30ø C?400ø C with a heating rate of 20ø C/minute.,contradiction
A curve was recorded between rate of heat flow versus temperature.,contradiction
From the curve it is clear that there is only one endothermic peak between 245.20ø C to 263.05ø C with a peak height 73.7977 mW.,contradiction
From the parameters shown in Fig. 9 of specific heat capacity was calculated as described in earlier report [23] and its value comes out equal to 36.977 ñ 8 Jgm?1 K?1.,contradiction
"It is also known that higher the value of specific heat of the crystal, larger will be its damage threshold.",contradiction
Larger value of specific heat always decreases their temperature gradient.,contradiction
Due to decrease in temperature gradient possibility of formation of cracks in the crystal decreases which were also confirmed from nano-indentation results.,contradiction
"In the present work, LOMHCl crystal is cut and polished in a dimension of 5 ž 4x1 mm3 and placed in the sample cell and the PA signals were applied for different chopping frequencies from 10 Hz to 90 Hz.",contradiction
The recorded spectrum is shown in Fig. 10 and the normalized amplitude of the PA signal plotted against the square root of chopping frequency is shown in Fig. 11 .,contradiction
The thermal diffusivity of the crystal is derived as 1.099 (6) X 10?6 m2/s by curve fitting method adopting Barros Mela and Feriea [24].,contradiction
"The thermal conductivity and thermal effusivity are derived from the following relations.(5)k=??cp (6)e=?cp?where, ?, K, ?, cp and e are the thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, density, specific heat capacity and thermal effusivity of the crystal respectively.",contradiction
The calculated values are given in Table 2 .,contradiction
"From Table 2, it is clear that the thermal diffusivity of LOMHCl is 8.2, 2.4 and 2.5 times larger than the reported well known NLO materials such as, Tri Glycine Sulphate (TGS) [25], l-Arginine phosphate (LAP) [26], BaB2O4 [27] and very close to KDP.",contradiction
We have performed the number of trail run and found that these results are reproducible.,contradiction
The higher value of thermal diffusivity shows that this crystal can withstand for high power laser irradiation against thermal damage.,contradiction
"Similarly, thermal conductivity and thermal effusivity are also better than the listed crystals.",contradiction
It shows that the grown crystal is a potential material for photonic applications.,contradiction
"In metals electrons carry most of the heat and define the heat transport processes, but in dielectric materials the main contribution is attributed to phonons which are the quantum of vibration of adjacent atoms or molecules.",contradiction
"However, the heat transport properties are mainly affected by phonon-phonon scattering and phonon-defect scattering [28,29].",contradiction
"As discussed in high resolution XRD, this crystal has vacancy and interstitial defects.",contradiction
These defects always reduce the heat transport process due to the phonon-defect scattering and such scattering can be reduced by minimizing the defects by growing the crystals in better conditions.,contradiction
"1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL ECX 400 NMR spectrometer operating at 400 and 100.0 MHz, respectively.",contradiction
Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to the signals of deuterated oxide (D2O) or residual solvent signals.,contradiction
"1H and 13C NMR, and heteronuclear chemical shift correlation (HETCOR) experiments were carried out to confirm the composition of the LOMHCl crystals.Image The 1H NMR spectrum of LOMHCl (400 MHz, D2O) revealed one multiplet at ? 1.53?1.82 ppm for 4H (C-3H and C-4H).",contradiction
"Two triplets appearing at 2.91 for 2H (C-5H, J = 7.4 Hz) and at 3.64 for 1H (C-2H, J = 6.0 Hz).",contradiction
"13C NMR revealed peaks at 22.7 (C-4), 27.4 (C-3), 38.8 (C-5), 54.1 (C-2).",contradiction
Good quality single crystals of LOMHCl were successfully grown by slow evaporation solution technique.,contradiction
HRXRD results conclude that the grown crystals have good crystalline perfection and presence of insignificant vacancy type point defects.,contradiction
Nano indentation analysis indicates that the crystal has moderate mechanical stability which is highly required for laser applications.,contradiction
"Moreover, photo acoustic results confirmed that the crystal has very high value of thermal conductivity, thermal effusivity and thermal diffusivity as compared to other amino acid compound that make it suitable for photonic devices.",contradiction
The detailed characterization analyses conveyed that the grown crystal is highly useful for making second harmonic based devices for nonlinear optical applications.,contradiction
"In recent years, nanoscale materials have attracted the attention of researchers because of applicability very-big in the fields as mechanics, electronics, optics and magnetic etc [1].",contradiction
"In it, the mechanical properties of Nano-materials are an increasingly important scientific field for the construction of materials of a particular mechanical nature.",contradiction
"However, it has become a huge challenge for the experimental method because nanoscale material very manipulation becomes difficult [2,3].",contradiction

"So not fully resolved, further research needed to clarify the problem.",contradiction
Upon closer inspection it can be seen that there are several crucial differences between these simulations that could explain the inconsistencies in the results.,contradiction
"For example, molecular dynamics simulates the movement of atoms and molecules using an interatomic potential to define forces between interacting particles.",contradiction
"There are several types of many-body potentials including the embedded atom method (EAM), modified embedded atom method (MEAM), Finnis-Sinclair (FS), and ReaxFF.",contradiction
"Further, within each potential there are several subsets for gold that have been parameterized for different purposes against different parameter sets.",contradiction
Parameterization involves fitting the potential against a database that can include both fitting parameters and experimental results.,contradiction
"Next, the result is often tested against certain material properties such as surface energies, point defects, and elastic constants.",contradiction
"Therefore, while some potentials have not even been trained or tested against bulk elastic properties, others have specifically been tested against data sets for mechanical properties at room temperature.",contradiction
"However, of the studies mentioned above there was no consistency in the type of potential used to simulate the nanowire.",contradiction
Limited research has indicated that potential type can be critical to the accuracy of nanowire simulations.,contradiction
"For example, Xu et al. [11] compared mechanical properties for silicon nanowires using three different MEAM potentials.",contradiction
Properties were shown to be dependent on the parameterization of the potential and elastic modulus was reduced with decreasing cross-section for all potentials.,contradiction
As can be seen from the above review while many MD studies on nanowires have been completed there is a large discrepancy in the predicted elastic modulus and the effect of nanowire cross-sectional size.,contradiction
No study has attempted to determine the sources of these errors and answer why seemingly similar studies predict such drastically different results.,contradiction
"While it may seem intuitive to only use a potential that has been developed specifically for nanowires, the majority of the studies above used potentials tested only for bulk samples.",contradiction
"Therefore, studies may be introducing unintended error by simply using a potential that was not meant to simulate nanowires.",contradiction
"Similarly, the statistical ensembles used to equilibrate nanowires to various temperatures can also affect the structure and stresses of the equilibrated wire.",contradiction
There is currently no study that compares the predicted mechanical properties of gold nanowires at different sizes and temperatures for various potentials and equilibration techniques.,contradiction
"Further, there is limited data on the effect of temperature on predicted elastic modulus as many studies consider only one or two temperatures.",contradiction
"As such, the purpose of this study was to use molecular dynamics to determine the effect of potential type on elastic modulus and to determine whether this may explain the discrepancies in results between previous studies.",contradiction
"In addition, this study builds on the results of previous literature by determining the influence of equilibration technique and temperature on the elastic modulus of gold nanowires.",contradiction
Molecular dynamics simulations utilize an interatomic potential to define forces between interacting particles [12].,contradiction
"This potential allows for calculation of the atomic acceleration and, using Newton?s equations of motion, the subsequent position and velocity at the next time step.",contradiction
Therefore the interatomic potential used is critical to obtaining accurate simulation results.,contradiction
In modern molecular simulations many-body potentials are now the most commonly used due to their ability to account for interactions between neighboring atoms.,contradiction
Energy is calculated as a sum of neighboring interactions and bonds are dynamic depending on the structure?s configuration [12].,contradiction
"For nanowire simulations, the most commonly used many-body potential is the embedded atom method (EAM).",contradiction
The EAM potential was originally proposed by Daw and Baskes [13] to avoid the problem of volume definition in the quasiatom theory.,contradiction
"Energy in the potential is defined as the sum of pairwise interactions combined with an embedding energy term that accounts for the energy in embedding each atom in the electron based density as per Eq. (1):(1)E=?iFi?h,i+12?i,ji=?j?ijrijwhere, ?h,i is the host electron density at atom i due to the remaining atoms in the system, Fi?h,i is the energy to embed atom i into the background electron density ?, and ?ijrijis the core-core pair repulsion between atoms i and j separated by the distance rij Similar to EAM, the modified embedded atom method (MEAM) also follows the form of Eq. (1).",contradiction
"However, the MEAM potential adds an angle dependency to the embedded energy term, making it more suitable for the various crystal structures found in metals [14].",contradiction
ReaxFF is a more recently developed bond order based potential that allows for simulation of bond breaking and reformation in a body.,contradiction
"System energy is calculated as the sum of energy contributions from bonding, over/under coordination, lone pair, valence, torsion, Van der Waals and Coulomb energy respectively (Eq. (2))[15]:(2)Esystem=Ebond+Eover+Eunder+Elp+Eval+Etor+EvdWaals+ECoulomb Bond order is then used to determine the interactions between all atoms in the system by accounting for the various covalent bond types as a function of the distance between atoms.",contradiction
ReaxFF is able to consider both the connectivity dependent and non-bonded interactions that occur within a body.,contradiction
Connectivity reactions depend on bond order and are eliminated when bonds are broken.,contradiction
"In contrast, non-bonded interactions, such as Van der Waals and Coulomb interactions, are present regardless of the connectivity between atoms.",contradiction
"Therefore, given its ability to model both bonded and non-bonded atomic interactions, ReaxFF is applicable to both covalent and metallic bonded systems.",contradiction
"Another key difference in the ReaxFF potential is that, depending on its parameterization, it allows for reactions and bonding between several atom types during a simulation.",contradiction
"Therefore, while previously discussed potentials are typically only used for pure materials, ReaxFF allows for the interaction of gold with various impurities.",contradiction
Further detail on the ReaxFF method can be found in van Duin et al. [15].,contradiction
When attempting to equilibrate nanowires at various simulation temperatures there are two commonly used statistical techniques; thermostatting and barostatting.,contradiction
"In both cases, equilibration is achieved by performing time integration on the Nose-Hoover style equations of motion to update the positions and velocities of atoms in a group.",contradiction
"In a thermostat an NVT ensemble is used to reach a predefined temperature while keeping the number, volume, and temperature of the atoms constant.",contradiction
"Therefore, the simulation box is kept at a constant volume while pressure in the system is allowed to change.",contradiction
"In a barostat an NPT ensemble is used to reach the desired temperature while keeping the number, pressure, and temperature constant.",contradiction
"Therefore, in contrast to an NVT ensemble, the system volume is allowed to change while keeping the pressure constant.",contradiction
Depending on the structure considered these equilibration methods might be affecting the resulting mechanical properties.,contradiction
"For example, bulk samples are typically modelled using periodic boundary conditions where a small representative unit cell is surrounded by image cells.",contradiction
"Particles in the unit cell behave as being connected to one?s image cells, allowing for simulation of an essentially infinite bulk.",contradiction
"Therefore, when periodic boundary conditions are used there is no surface atom effect and there is typically not a drastic difference between the equilibration methods.",contradiction
"However, nanowires have a high surface to volume ratio and cannot be modelled using periodic boundary conditions.",contradiction
"Instead, the high aspect ratio of the nanowires is modelled using free edges that account for surface effects.",contradiction
The contraction or initial stresses caused by the equilibration method can potentially affect the structure of the equilibrated nanowire.,contradiction
"For example, in a study of gold nanowires Koh and Lee [7] demonstrated that initial stresses were present in NVT equilibrated nanowires.",contradiction
The source of these stresses was attributed to the availability of open bonds and the asymmetrical nature of bonding at the surface atoms.,contradiction
"As a result, surface atoms were at a higher electronic state and thus possessed a higher electronic cohesive energy than bulk atoms.",contradiction
This gradient in cohesive energy resulted in surface tension in the restrained surface and contraction in the unrestrained surface.,contradiction
"Therefore as the cross-sectional size of the nanowire is decreased, and thus the ratio of surface atoms with respect to total atoms is increased, initial stresses become even more prevalent.",contradiction
One method to reduce these initial stresses in an equilibrated nanowire is to use the NPT equilibration technique.,contradiction
"As described above, the NPT barostat allows the volume to change while maintaining a specific pressure.",contradiction
This allows the nanowire to contract in length to reduce the initial stresses.,contradiction
"Overall, while the NPT method is far more commonly used for nanowires, both methods have been utilized in previous studies.",contradiction
"For example, Olsson et al. [9] studied the effect of cross-sectional size on gold nanowires and used an NPT barostat to equilibrate the nanowire without initial stresses; achieving a free relaxation state before external loading.",contradiction
"In contrast, Zhan et al. [16] used the NVT equilibration method and commented on the presence of initial stresses during straining.",contradiction
"Therefore, depending on the equilibration method and cross-section, nanowires may have high initial stresses.",contradiction
"However, no study has actually compared equilibration methods for identical gold nanowires to definitively comment on their differences.",contradiction
To test the influence of potential type and equilibration method various sized nanowires were placed in tension at 100?400 K to generate a stress-strain curve.,contradiction
The resulting curves were then used to determine the mechanical properties of the gold nanowire as a function of temperature and potential type.,contradiction
"Simulations were performed utilizing Large-scale atomistic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS), a molecular dynamics program from Sandia National Laboratories [17,18].",contradiction
"First, FCC gold nanowires with cross-sections of 4 ž 4, 6 ž 6 and 8 ž 8 nm2 and ?1 0 0? orientations were prepared (Fig. 1 ).",contradiction
"The length to thickness ratio of all nanowires was fixed at 4-1 and the number of atoms for each nanowire wire was 15 800 for 4 ž 4 nm2, 53 500 for 6 ž 6 nm2, and 126 400 for 8 ž 8 nm2.",contradiction
"Nanowire geometries were chosen to match similar previous studies [7,19].",contradiction
Periodic boundary conditions were used in the axial direction while the other surfaces were kept free.,contradiction
Several options for each potential type were used to simulate the atomistic tension test of the nanowire [20].,contradiction
"In total, 2 EAM, 1 MEAM, and 1 ReaxFF potential were tested for their ability to predict mechanical properties of a nanowire from an atomistic uniaxial tension test (Table 1 ).",contradiction
"First, the Foiles 1986 EAM potential was developed to describe FCC metals through fitting to the sublimation energy, lattice constant, elastic constants, and vacancy formation energy [21].",contradiction
"Similarly, the Olsson 2010 EAM potential was developed specifically for gold and was again trained against a set of parameters [9].",contradiction
"The resulting potential was then evaluated by testing its ability to predict defect formation energies, elastic constants, and surface energies.",contradiction
The Baskes 1992 MEAM potential was developed to describe 26 elements including 10 FCC metals [22].,contradiction
During development the potential was trained against 12 different parameters and the result was tested against experimental values.,contradiction
"Finally, the Keith 2010 ReaxFF potential was developed to reproduce density functional theory calculations on gold bulk structures, surfaces, and nanoparticles [23].",contradiction
The resulting potential was applied to annealing simulations on gold nanoparticles.,contradiction
"While it is possible to parameterize potentials for a specific purpose, this can be extremely complex and time consuming.",contradiction
"As such, the potentials discussed above were used as is with the goal of determining which readily available potentials are most accurate for nanowires and why.",contradiction
After setting up the nanowire and choosing a potential the structure was then equilibrated to the prescribed temperature using an NPT barostat.,contradiction
"Due to the free surfaces found on the nanowire, equilibration with the NPT barostat was conducted by controlling only the periodic axial direction to zero pressure.",contradiction
Equilibration was conducted over 75 ps to ensure ample time for temperatures and pressure to settle.,contradiction
A sample equilibration curve is shown in Fig. 2 .,contradiction
"As per previous work, pressures fluctuated slightly between ñ0.05 GPa and equilibration occurred well within 50 ps [7,9].",contradiction
"After equilibration, the nanowires were then strained in a uniaxial tension test with an NVT thermostat to control temperature during deformation.",contradiction
Each structure was deformed in the axial direction with a strain rate of 0.001 per picosecond (1e9 per second).,contradiction
Due to computational limits caused by the scale of molecular dynamics this strain rate is significantly higher than what is typically seen for macroscale lab tests.,contradiction
"However, previous simulations on the effect of strain rate on the mechanical properties of gold nanowire concluded that strain rate did not effect elastic properties below a rate of 1e10 per second [7].",contradiction
"Therefore, a strain rate of 1e9 per second was selected as it is an order of magnitude below this critical value and similar to values used in previous studies on gold nanowires [7,19].",contradiction
To ensure comparable tests were being conducted the strain rates were kept equal for all potentials.,contradiction
"Stresses at each step were calculated using the virial atomic stress tensor, which has been shown to be equivalent to the continuum Cauchy stress [24] as per Eq. (3):(3)Sab=-?imiviavib+12?i?j=?iFijarijbwhere mi and vi are the mass and velocity of the atomi, Fij is the force between atomsi andj, rij is the distance between atomsi andj, and the indices a andb denote the Cartesian components.",contradiction
The slope of the resulting stress-strain curve was then used to predict the elastic modulus for each potential considered.,contradiction
Slopes were sampled up to 3% strain in the linear region of the stress-strain curve where Hooke?s law was applicable.,contradiction
To test the influence of equilibration method the above procedure was repeated with an NVT thermostat during temperature equilibration.,contradiction
The final step of this study was to consider how the method used to equilibrate the nanowire to its simulation temperature could influence its behaviour upon loading.,contradiction
The NPT barostat is more commonly used to describe nanowires as it allows for contraction in length to reduce initial stresses.,contradiction
"In contrast, the NVT thermostat achieves the target temperature while fixing the volume of the nanowire.",contradiction
To determine the effect of the temperature equilibration method the procedure above was replicated while using an NVT thermostat to equilibrate the nanowire to the prescribed temperature.,contradiction
"The Keith 2010 ReaxFF potential was not considered due to its large error in the NPT equilibration method, its disagreement with experimental trends, and its lack of parameterization for elastic properties.",contradiction
Fig. 7 provides a sample of the equilibration process for the temperature and pressure of an 8 ž 8 nm2 nanowire.,contradiction
"Similar to the NPT equilibration method, the structure quickly reaches a stable temperature within the equilibration time.",contradiction
"However, when tracking the pressures the discrepancies between equilibration methods become stark.",contradiction
The NPT equilibration allows for the nanowire to contract in length to reduce initial stresses.,contradiction
"In contrast, the NVT method fixes the length, resulting in high initial pressures that are likely the source of inaccuracies in mechanical properties.",contradiction
"First, for the Foiles 1986 potential the elastic modulus for the 4 ž 4 nm2 nanowire was significantly higher (35%) when equilibrated with an NVT thermostat (Table 4 ).",contradiction
"However, as the nanowire increased in cross-sectional size there was a much smaller difference between the two methods (Table 5 ).",contradiction
"For example, at 200 K, the elastic modulus for the 4 ž 4 nm2 nanowire was 43% higher than the NPT equilibrated nanowire.",contradiction
"However, at 6 ž 6 nm2 and 8 ž 8 nm2 cross-sections, this difference reduced to only 5% and 1%.These findings agree with the work of Koh and Lee [7] who demonstrated that initial surface stresses were higher in lower diameter nanowires due to an increased ratio of surface atoms in tension.",contradiction
For the Olsson 2010 and Baskes 1992 potentials there was less of an obvious difference between the two equilibration methods.,contradiction
"Furthermore, while the NVT equilibrated nanowires agreed with the trend of decreasing elastic modulus with increasing temperature, the majority of the simulated nanowires dropped in elastic modulus when moving from a cross-section of 4 ž 4 nm2 to 6 ž 6 nm2.",contradiction
"Subsequently, when the cross-sectional size was increased from 6 ž 6 nm2 to 8 ž 8 nm2 the elastic modulus increased; as expected and observed in this study and previous works.",contradiction
"Therefore, the initial surface stresses in smaller cross-sectional nanowires caused by NVT equilibration have a larger effect on the predicted elastic modulus.",contradiction
"As described above, each nanowire was placed in uniaxial tension and the slope of the resulting stress-strain curve was used to calculate an elastic modulus for the nanowire.",contradiction
Fig. 3 provides a sample of the stress-strain curves for the Foiles 1986 (Fig. 3A?C) and Olsson 2010 (Fig. 3D?F) potentials.,contradiction
"Referring to Table 1, it is clear that potential type can have a significant effect on predicted elastic modulus.",contradiction
"First, for the Olsson 2010 and Foiles 1986 potentials the elastic modulus increased with cross-sectional size ? approaching bulk values.",contradiction
"As discussed in previous studies, the source of this elastic softening with reduced cross-section is due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio found in smaller cross-section nanowires.",contradiction
With decreasing diameter the proportion of surface atoms grows significantly.,contradiction
Atoms on the surface cannot form perfect FCC lattice structures and will therefore construct incomplete lattices.,contradiction
During the deformation process these incomplete lattice effects can lead to a significant reduction in strength.,contradiction
"Therefore, lower diameter nanowires with higher proportions of incomplete FCC lattice structures can be expected to have a decreased elastic modulus [8].",contradiction
"Moreover, as observed by both Koh and Lee [7] and Wang et al. [8], lower diameter nanowires may experience some surface pre-melting, potentially further softening the elastic modulus.",contradiction
"However as diameter increases, the ratio of surface atoms to volume atoms subsequently decreases and the effect of these free surfaces on mechanical properties becomes less significant.",contradiction
"This trend agrees with previous work on gold nanowires [7,9] and with other metallic nanowire simulations [19,25].",contradiction
The Olsson 2010 potential consistently predicted an elastic modulus approximately 1.5 times higher than Foiles 1986.,contradiction
"In addition, both potentials also predicted a softening of the elastic modulus with temperature, as commonly observed in both bulk samples [9,26] and on several simulations of similar sized metallic nanowires [8,9,27,28].",contradiction
This trend was observed for all sizes and temperatures besides the 4 nm nanowire at 400 K simulated using the Foiles 1986 potential where the modulus was slightly higher than expected.,contradiction
"Similar to the EAM potentials, the Baskes 1992 MEAM potential predicted a trend of increasing elastic modulus with increasing cross-sectional size.",contradiction
"However, the MEAM potential also predicted a trend of increasing modulus with temperature, opposing the results of the two EAM potentials and previous simulations on gold and other metallic nanowires [9,26].",contradiction
"As a result, at higher temperatures the elastic modulus values were significantly higher than those predicted by the EAM potentials.",contradiction
"Finally, at all temperatures the ReaxFF potential (Keith 2010) predicted an elastic modulus significantly higher than any other potential tested.",contradiction
"Moreover, there was no clear trend in elastic modulus with cross-sectional size.",contradiction
"For all temperatures the elastic modulus dropped from the 4 nm to 6 nm cross-section, and then again increased from the 6 nm to 8 nm cross-section.",contradiction
"Further, while ReaxFF potentials offer the ability to create and break bonds during simulation, they are also significantly more computationally demanding.",contradiction
"Next, to compare the relative accuracy of these potentials previously conducted experimental studies on gold nanowires were considered.",contradiction
"Due to the dependence of elastic modulus on cross-sectional size, crystal orientation, and temperature, care had to be taken to find relevant experimental work.",contradiction
It is important to note that experimental data on nanowires is extremely limited due to the difficulty in manufacturing and testing small cross-section nanowires.,contradiction
"While such data is limited, Petrova et al. [3] studied the elastic modulus of [1 0 0] gold nanowires using a transient absorption experiment.",contradiction
The study measured an elastic modulus of 39.1 GPa for an 8 nm ñ 1 nm cross-section ?1 0 0? gold nanowire at room temperature and concluded that crystal orientation can affect mechanical properties.,entailment
"Therefore, these experimental results matched the material, size, and crystal orientation that were simulated.",contradiction
"Referring to Table 2 , of the EAM/MEAM potentials tested, the Olsson 2010 potential agrees best with the experimental data (44.1 GPa) while the MEAM potential had the highest average error.",contradiction
"Moreover, the ReaxFF potential had the highest error of all potentials.",contradiction
Slight errors relative to experimental values can most likely be attributed to imperfect nanowires that may possess impurities and other point defects that have not been captured in the simulation.,contradiction
"Due to the nanoscale nature of these structures, defects may affect experimental values more than typical macroscale samples.",contradiction
"In addition, the experimental nanowire size had an error of ñ1 nm.",contradiction
"Therefore, depending on the actual cross-section of the nanowire, the error may actually be reduced.",contradiction
"However, based on the large error difference between the various potentials, it is clear that potential type alone can have a significant influence on the accuracy of predicted elastic properties.",contradiction
"While simulation results agree reasonably well with experimental elastic moduli, the effect of cross-section size contrasts experimental results.",contradiction
"As observed by this study and several others, nanowire simulations consistently predict a reduction in elastic modulus with decreased cross-section [7,9,19,25].",contradiction
"As stated prior, the source of this reduction is a higher proportion of surface atoms with respect to bulk atoms.",contradiction
These surface atoms do not form perfect FCC structures and can lead to a reduction in strength.,contradiction
"In contrast, experimental data has suggested that a decreased cross-section will lead to an increase in the elastic modulus [4,6].",contradiction
A significant reason why experimental data is limited for nanowires is due to the complexity in controlling impurities and other defects during fabrication.,contradiction
"As acknowledged by McDowell et al. [4], the reported experimental data may be artificially enhanced by unintended surface contaminants or oxide layers formed during fabrication.",contradiction
"Smaller cross-section nanowires would be even more affected by these impurities, potentially explaining why they see the highest elastic moduli.",contradiction
Further research is needed to explain why experiments and simulations on nanowires appear to disagree on the effect of cross-sectional size on elastic modulus.,contradiction
"Next, the parameterization and purpose for development of each potential tested was investigated to shed light on the source of their relative accuracies.",contradiction
"First, the Keith 2010 ReaxFF potential was the most inaccurate potential for nanowire gold structures.",contradiction
"However, this potential was developed to describe gold surfaces and nanoparticles [23].",contradiction
"While the potential accurately predicted lattice constants and cohesive energies for FCC gold, the authors noted that it significantly over predicted the elastic constants.",contradiction
The authors concluded that the potential was simply not as accurate as others for elastic properties.,contradiction
"Therefore, this highlights the importance of performing a pre-assessment of available potentials prior to simulation.",contradiction
"While ReaxFF offers the unique ability to break and form bonds during simulation, further research is needed to obtain a more accurate gold ReaxFF potential for mechanical properties.",contradiction
"Similar to the Keith 2010 ReaxFF potential, the Baskes 1992 MEAM potential was also not parameterized with or tested against elastic constants and was only shown to be accurate with the shear modulus elastic modulus [22].",contradiction
"Moreover, while surface energies were considered, no effort was made to quantify the effect of free surfaces on elastic properties at high temperatures.",contradiction
"Therefore, this likely explains why the potential was relatively inaccurate for nanowire elastic modulus.",contradiction
"In contrast, the Foiles 1986 EAM potential was specifically parameterized by fitting against the elastic constants, lattice constants, and vacancy energies for pure FCC metals [21].The validity of the potential was then demonstrated by accurately calculating a wide range of properties including the surface energy, formation energy, vacancy energy, and geometry of [1 0 0] FCC gold with periodic boundary conditions [21].",contradiction
"Therefore, given its parameterization to elastic constants, the Foiles 1986 potential was more suitable for nanowires than those potentials without any elastic parameterization.",contradiction
"However, no mention of nanowires was made or how free surfaces can affect resulting elastic constants and comparisons were made only at 0 K.",contradiction
"Finally, as opposed to fitting with elastic constants, the Olsson 2010 potential was first parameterized to 13 different constants and then tested for its ability to predict the elastic constants and surface formation energies of [1 0 0] gold [9].",contradiction
The potential was also developed to describe the linear thermal expansion coefficient between 0 and 700 K.,contradiction
"Therefore, this potential was likely more suitable to the higher temperatures used in the current study.",contradiction
"Finally, the potential was then used to predict the mechanical properties and transverse resonant properties of nanowires at both 4 K and 300 K.",contradiction
"Therefore, these findings point to the importance of parameterization with elastic constants, thermal expansion coefficients, and surface energies to be able to accurately simulate a nanowire structure.",contradiction
"After demonstrating the importance of potentials in obtaining an accurate elastic modulus, the next question was whether potential type was the source of discrepancies found in previous studies.",contradiction
"First, similar to the present study, the Olsson 2010 potential was used to simulate gold nanowires at 4 K and 300 K [9].",contradiction
"As discussed above, this potential was developed with surface energy, elastic constants, and realizable temperatures in mind.",contradiction
The study predicted an elastic modulus of 41.8 GPa for a 7.34 ž 7.34 nm2 nanowire equilibrated using an NPT barostat.,entailment
"Moreover, elastic modulus was predicted to increase with increasing cross-sectional size.",contradiction
"Therefore, these results agree well with both experimental results and with the present simulation results, further supporting the accuracy of the Olsson 2010 potential.",contradiction
"Next, the Baskes 1992 MEAM potential was used by Diao et al. [29] to simulate a tension test of various diameter FCC nanowires.",contradiction
The study first attempted to verify the potential by testing the elastic modulus for bulk samples at various orientations.,contradiction
"Results showed strong agreement to bulk experimental values, leading to the conclusion that the potential was suitable for nanowires.",contradiction
"Next, the results predicted a nanowire elastic modulus of approximately 42 GPa, independent of nanowire size.",entailment
"While this may at first appear to be accurate to the experimental room temperature value, there are several issues with these findings.",contradiction
"First, all simulations were conducted at 0 K, a non-realizable temperature that cannot be compared to room temperature experimental values where elastic modulus should be softened.",contradiction
"Next, the conclusion that elastic modulus was independent of cross-sectional size disagrees with previous literature on gold and metallic nanowires [7,9,19,25].",contradiction
"Therefore, the fact that these simulations predicted little change with nanowire diameter (at diameters above 2 nm) likely points to the importance of including realistic temperatures in nanowire simulations.",contradiction
It is the temperature of the nanowire that introduces a change in the surface energy due to the relatively high proportion of surface atoms to bulk atoms in the nanostructure.,contradiction
In the absence of temperature this energy change is negligible and therefore should not affect the predicted elastic modulus.,contradiction
"Finally, as demonstrated in the current study, the Baskes MEAM potential was not developed to describe nanowires and was inaccurate when compared to experimental results.",contradiction
"Therefore, the use of an unsuitable potential explains a large portion of the error relative to other studies and experimental results.",contradiction
"Finally, a Sutton Chen type potential was used by Koh and Lee [7] to describe the tensile behaviour of gold nanowires between 2 nm and 6 nm diameter at 300 K.",contradiction
The predicted elastic modulus was between 66 and 81 GPa and was significantly higher than observed in previous studies.,entailment
"While this potential is not available specifically in LAMMPS, it was developed based on the lattice constants and bulk modulus of FCC metals.",contradiction
"However, the potential was not tested with higher temperatures or parameterized with surface energies.",contradiction
"Therefore, while likely suitable for bulk materials, it was unable to accurately simulate the mechanical behaviour of nanowires.",contradiction
"Moreover, as opposed to comparing results against experimental nanowire values, the study compared nanowire modulus with bulk elastic modulus.",contradiction
The author?s concluded that error compared to bulk was a shortcoming of the potential used [7].,contradiction
"However, error should have been compared with nanowire values where it would have been clear that modulus was being over predicted and not under predicted relative to bulk.",contradiction
"In summary, the differences in both elastic moduli and the effect of cross-section appear to be a result of studies using unsuitable potentials for the task at hand.",contradiction
"As discussed above, many previous studies have used potentials unsuitable for nanowires.",contradiction
"The choice of potential was commonly rationalized based on parameterization with bulk properties or, in the case of Diao et al., by testing the potential for bulk properties first [10].",contradiction
"While parameterization with bulk properties certainly does not guarantee accuracy, the highest errors appear to be observed for those potentials not parameterized with any elastic properties.",contradiction
"Therefore, the next step was to determine whether accuracy in simulating mechanical properties from a bulk sample corresponds to accuracy in simulating mechanical properties for a nanowire.",contradiction
To accomplish this each potential was also tested for its ability to simulate mechanical properties from a periodic cell undergoing uniaxial tension.,contradiction
"A 15ax15ax15a cubic slab of bulk gold (where a is the lattice unit for gold, a = 4.0782 A?) with periodic boundaries in the x-, y-, and z-directions was developed, equilibrated to 300 K using an NPT barostat, and then strained in the [1 0 0] direction using the same strain rate as above.",contradiction
The resulting slope of the stress-strain curve was then used to predict the elastic modulus of [1 0 0] gold.,contradiction
"Finally, the elastic modulus was compared to the elastic modulus of [1 0 0] bulk gold obtained through experiment at room temperature [29].",contradiction
"Referring to Table 3 , as with the nanowire elastic modulus, the potentials predicted a wide range of elastic moduli from the atomistic tension test.",contradiction
"Moreover, both the MEAM and ReaxFF potentials again over predicted the elastic modulus and had significant error.",contradiction
"Therefore, those potentials without parameterization for bulk elastic properties were inaccurate for both nanowires and bulk samples.",contradiction
"In contrast, both of the EAM potentials were parameterized with elastic constants and showed better accuracy to bulk properties.",contradiction
"However, the Olsson 2010 potential, which was more accurate for nanowires, had an error of 26% for bulk properties (almost three times higher than when predicting mechanical properties of nanowires).",contradiction
"Therefore, the potential most accurate for predicting elastic modulus from a uniaxial tension test of a bulk sample was not the most accurate for the nanowire.",contradiction
"Similarly, the Foiles 1986 potential had an error of only 7% for bulk properties as compared to almost 20% for nanowires.",contradiction
"Therefore, while demonstrating accuracy for elastic properties of a bulk sample may indicate possible accuracy for nanowires, it is not sufficient to determine which potential is more accurate.",contradiction
"In contrast, developing the potential with elastic constants, surface energies, and thermal properties appears to be a better indicator of applicability for nanowires.",contradiction
"After demonstrating that the Olsson 2010 potential was the most accurate at describing the elastic modulus of nanowires, the study then investigated the evolution of defects in the nanowire at different points during straining.",contradiction
"To accomplish this, the evolution and nucleation of dislocations and stacking faults was studied using the centrosymmetry parameter (CSP) [33] which is defined as:(4)ci=?j=1N/2(Rj+Rj+N/2)2where N is the number of nearest neighbour atoms (12 for FCC structures) and R is the vector from the atom cito a pair of opposite nearest neighbours.",contradiction
"The CSP value can be used to detect a perfect lattice (CSP = 0) or various defects such as dislocations, partial dislocations stacking faults, and free surfaces.",contradiction
Fig. 4 shows the evolution of partial dislocations and stacking faults during straining of a 4 ž 4 nm2 nanowire simulated using the Olsson 2010 potential along with the corresponding locations on the stress-strain curve.,contradiction
A filter is used to highlight those atoms with CSP values corresponding to dislocations.,contradiction
"The first partial dislocation (Shockley partial 1/6 ?1 1 2?) in the nanowire nucleates at approximately 5.25% strain, near the end of the elastic region (Fig. 4A).",contradiction
"This partial dislocation then quickly grows, leaving stacking faults in the nanowire at 5.75% strain (Fig. 4B).",contradiction
"New partial dislocations and stacking faults then rapidly grow from these existing stacking faults, corresponding to the end of the elastic region and the onset of yielding at 6.5% strain (Fig. 4C).",contradiction
"Finally, after yielding these stacking faults and dislocations grow into a large network throughout the nanowire, corresponding to the reduction in stress in the plastic region of the stress-strain curve (Fig. 4D).",contradiction
"Therefore, the behaviour observed from the stress-strain curve is supported through investigating the evolution of partial dislocation and stacking faults in the microstructure.",contradiction
This method can also be used to better understand the effect of both temperature and cross-section.,contradiction
"For example, Fig. 5 shows the microstructure for the 8 ž 8 nanowire during different strain increments at 300 K.",contradiction
"Partial dislocations first nucleate at 7.5% strain (Fig. 5A) and leave stacking faults at 8% strain (Fig. 5B), corresponding to the ultimate stress found in the nanowire and the end of the elastic region.",contradiction
"Further partial dislocations then nucleate from these stacking faults, creating a complex network of faults and dislocations during the plastic portion of the stress strain curve.",contradiction
"Therefore, the end of the elastic region and evolution of defects occurs much later in larger diameter nanowires (8% strain as compared to 6.5% strain).",contradiction
"Similarly, Fig. 6 shows the microstructure for the 8 ž 8 nm2 nanowire during different strain increments at 100 K.",contradiction
A partial dislocation first nucleates at 8.3% strain (Fig. 6A) and then quickly forms into a network of stacking faults corresponding to the end of the elastic region (Fig. 6B).,contradiction
These stacking faults and dislocations then further grow throughout the nanowire as straining continues in the plastic region (Fig. 6C).,contradiction
"Therefore, the strain at the end of the elastic region is slightly higher in the lower temperature nanowire.",contradiction
"Overall, the tensile deformation process of gold nanowires appears to be dominated by the nucleation and propagation of partial defects throughout the nanowire.",contradiction
"Overall, MD offers an exciting opportunity to study and better understand nanowires and the role purity, defects, and environment can have on behaviour during loading.",contradiction
"However, many studies that simulated gold nanowires predicted different results and trends and did not keep the potential type or equilibration method consistent.",contradiction
"Therefore, the current study provided a detailed analysis into nanowires by considering how potential type, cross-sectional size, temperature, and equilibration method can affect the predicted elastic modulus of gold nanowires.",contradiction
The outcome of the current study demonstrates the need for proper simulation methods.,contradiction
Results from this study indicated several important conclusions:?The potential type had a significant effect on mechanical properties.,contradiction
"Therefore, care must be taken to ensure a potential is parameterized and suitable for use with nanowires before application.",contradiction
"Accuracy at simulating bulk mechanical properties from uniaxial tension did not necessarily indicate accuracy when simulating nanowires.?Discrepancies in elastic modulus in previously reported studies appear to be caused by the use of potentials that were not suitable for nanowires at room temperature.?Both the Foiles 1986 and Olsson 2010 potential correctly predicted a trend of decreasing elastic modulus with increasing temperature and decreasing cross-sectional size.?The Olsson 2010 potential was the most accurate and was parameterized with bulk elastic constants, surface energies, and thermal expansion coefficients at a large range of temperatures.?While ReaxFF offers the ability to model bond formation and breaking, it was the least accurate of all potentials tested.",contradiction
Further research is needed to develop a ReaxFF potential suitable for nanowire deformation.?The equilibration method had a significant effect on the elastic modulus of the 4 ž 4nm2 nanowires.,contradiction
"The First-principle calculations were performed by the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the CASTEP code (Clark et al., 2005), where the local density approximation (LDA) with CA?PZ parameterization (Perdew and Zunger, 1981; Ceperley and Alder, 1980) for the exchange-correlation interaction and Norm-conserving pseudopotentials (Hamann et al., 1979) in modeling the electron-ion interaction were respectively adopted.",contradiction
"The elastic constants were determined by stress?strain relations (Karki et al., 2001).",contradiction
"The magnitudes of all applied strains in calculation were 0.01, such that the linear relation could be adopted.",contradiction
Quartz has a trigonal crystal structure with a space group of P3221.,contradiction
The hexagonal setting was selected in the calculation with its a- and c-directions respectively aligned to the x- and z-directions (Fig. 1 ).,contradiction
"In the calculation, the stresses ?xx, ?yy, and ?zz were respectively applied along the x-, y-, and z-directions in the regular orthorhombic spatial coordinate (XYZ) system.",contradiction
"Thus, the equivalent hydrostatic pressure (P, GPa) applied to crystals is (?xx + ?yy + ?zz)/3.",contradiction
Apparently the pressure is hydrostatic when ?xx = ?yy = ?zz and non-hydrostatic when ?xx =? ?yy or ?zz.,contradiction
"In case ?xx = ?yy = P, and ?zz = P + x, the ?d is defined and marked as ??xx = ??yy = 0 and ??zz = x GPa (x, the largest stress difference among the ?zz, ?yy, and ?xx), which would be used as one setup for our calculation.",contradiction
"Detail setups and other benchmarks for calculations can be found in the previous works (Liu et al., 2018, 2015).",contradiction
"Based on these setting, the effects of 9 different stress settings, including one that reflects hydrostatic pressure, on the structure and elasticity of quartz were calculated, with addition of ?d in the amount of ?0.5, ?1, 0.5 and 1 GPa respectively along a- and c-axis in each of these settings.",contradiction
The calculated results are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.,contradiction
"It shows that application of a negative ?d along an axis causes the enlargement of that axis and shrinkage of other axis, while application of positive ?d affect oppositely (Fig. 2).",contradiction
This effect is not affected by pressure at most cases (Figs. 2 and 3).,contradiction
The Poisson's effect turns out to remain effective at pressures.,contradiction
There are two exceptional cases where the axial elongation notably decreases with pressure elevation.,contradiction
"One is when apply positive ?d along c-direction (??xx:??yy:??zz = 0:0:0.5/1.0), the increment of a- and b-axis decreases at pressure elevation (Fig. 3).",contradiction
"The other is when apply negative ?d along c-direction (??xx:??yy:??zz = 0:0:?0.5/?1.0), the elongation of c-axis decreases at pressure elevation (Fig. 3).",contradiction
The differences of lattice constants under hydrostatic stress from non-hydrostatic stresses were plotted with ?d as Fig. 3.,contradiction
The effect of non-hydrostatic stress on lattice constants increases linearly with increasing ?d.,contradiction
"The differences in the lattice constants (a, b, and c) under hydrostatic stress compared to non-hydrostatic stresses with ?d were fitted by a linear equation and listed in Table 1 .",contradiction
The excellent linear relationship of the effect of non-hydrostatic stresses on the lattice constants of quartz can be used to deduce the stress state of the Earth interior.,contradiction
The volumes at nonhydrostatic stress were compared with their equivalent hydrostatic values.,contradiction
"At ??xx:??yy:??zz = 0:0:0.5(1.0) and =?0.5(?1.0):0:0, both cause the c-axial reduction and a-axial expansion, the volume become enlarged (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 1).",contradiction
"However, at ??xx:??yy:??zz = 0:0:?0.5(?1.0) and = 0/0.5(1.0):0:0, both reflect the c-axial expansion and a-axial reduction, the volume shrinks.",contradiction
This is due to the axial anisotropic compression of the crystal a and c axis.,contradiction
"This phenomenon is also found in forsterite and calcite (Liu et al., 2014, 2016).",contradiction
The quantity of volume variation is smaller than 1% at the degree of ?d applied in present calculation.,contradiction
"As shown in Fig. 5, the differences of bulk moduli under non-hydrostatic stress from that under hydrostatic stress are very small.",contradiction
The uncertainties of elastic modulus are 0.5GPa.,entailment
The differences of bulk modulus under hydrostatic stress compared to non-hydrostatic stresses are within the error.,contradiction
Therefore the non-hydrostatic stresses nearly have no effect on bulk modulus of quartz.,contradiction
"However, the shear moduli of quartz under non-hydrostatic stress differ from those at equivalent hydrostatic pressures.",contradiction
The degree of difference increases with increasing ?d.,contradiction
The differences of shear modulus under hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic stresses were fitted as Fig. 6 .,contradiction
"Compared with their equivalent hydrostatic values, the increments of shear modulus under ??xx:??yy:??zz = 0:0:?0.5 (?1.0) and =0.5 (1.0):0:0 conditions are respectively 1.1%, 1.9%, 0.6%, and 1%.",contradiction
"The reductions under ??xx:??yy:??zz = 0:0:0.5(1.0) and =?0.5(?1.0):0:0 conditions are respectively 1.1%, 2.1%, 0.7%, and 1.2%.",contradiction
This demonstrates that ?d induced alternation of shear modulus depends not only on positive and negative character of ?d but also equivalently on the axial direction that it applied.,contradiction
"Additionally, it is found that when the effect of ?d on shear modulus of quartz is more significant when it is applied along c-axis than applied along a-axis.",contradiction
Notably the effect of nonhydrostatic stress on bulk and shear moduli are consistence with the elastic constants.,contradiction
"The trigonal symmetry of quartz has 6 independent elastic constants (C11, C12, C13, C14, C33, and C44), and C66 = 1/2(C11-C12).",contradiction
"C11 and C33 correspond to longitudinal stress, C12, C13, and C14 off-diagonal stress, and C44 and C66 shear stress.",contradiction
"From the Fig. 7 , the effect of ?d on C33 is minimal and on C11 is slight.",contradiction
"Consequentially, the bulk modulus, reflecting the compressional performance of axial components, does not seem to be much affected.",contradiction
"Contrarily, C44 and C66, thus the shear modulus, is notably affected by ?d.",contradiction
"The calculated G, C44 and C66 have somewhat discrete because of the relatively low accuracy of the calculated off-diagonal and shear constants of the materials during the DFT simulation (Karki et al., 1997, 2001).",contradiction
The Young's modulus describes the characteristics of how a material responds linearly to stress.,contradiction
"We calculated the Young's modulus (Y) of the a, b, and c axis under hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic stress to understand the differences among lattice strain in different crystal axis (Figs. 8 and 9 ).",contradiction
"The Ya, Yb, and Yc are used to represent the Young's modulus in a, b, and c axis.",contradiction
The effect of ?d on axial Yong's modulus Yc is neglectable regardless of its application characters.,contradiction
"When ?d is applied along c-axis, Ya and Yb remain identical.",contradiction
"They increase with increasing ?d, in the amount of 1.6% and 3.2% at ??xx:??yy:??zz = 0:0:?0.5 and 0:0:?1.0, and decrease by 1.3% and 2.8% at ??xx:??yy:??zz = 0:0:0.5 and 0:0:1.0, respectively.",contradiction
"When applied along a-axis, Ya differs from Yb.",contradiction
"Yb decrease 0.7% and 0.75%, and Ya increase 1.1% and 3.3% respectively at ??xx:??yy:??zz = ?0.5:0:0 and ?1.0:0:0.",contradiction
"Both Ya and Yb become increased and the amounts of corresponding increments are respectively 1.1%, 3.3% and 2.2%, 5.5% at ??xx: ??yy: ??zz = 0.5: 0: 0 and 1.0: 0: 0.",contradiction
"It is remarkable that when positive ?d is applied along a-axis, both Ya and Yb increase instead of change oppositely as in the case of negative ?d being applied.",contradiction
"Previous analysis of the microstructure characteristics of quartz, jadeite, diabase and calcite determined that ?d in the Sesia Zone, Western Alps is 300 ñ 100 MPa (Ku?ster and Sto?ckhert, 1999).",contradiction
"The non-hydrostaticity in the Earth's interior is proved important because of reasons such as its connection to dynamical processes of the Earth (Ruff, 2001).",contradiction
Quartz has been mostly used in characterization of the stress state of the Crust.,contradiction
"For instance, the differential stress was determined on the order of 100 MPa from the deformation-induced microstructures of quartz collected from Moine thrust fault (Weathers et al., 1979).",contradiction
"However, the effect of ?d is mostly ignored in exploration of materials in depth of the Earth.",contradiction
"Beyond once more demonstration of the importance of non-hydrostaticity in study the Earth's interior, the present calculation finds the effect of non-hydrostaticity on the properties of quartz is quite complex, not only the degree, but equally important the orientation of differential stress in relevant to crystal lattice directions would remarkably affect its mechanical performance.",contradiction
It is thus reinstated that one has to consider to the crystal structure level in deducing the stress state of the Earth interior through strain analysis.,contradiction
The results of present work may lead to guideline for stress analytical process of the Earth interior with quartz.,contradiction
"For example, since non-hydrostaticity does not affect the bulk modulus, one could safely use the equation of state of quartz to determine the environmental (equivalent) pressure that the mineral subjected to with high precision.",contradiction
One then would be able to determine orientation of the differential stress corresponding to the crystal lattice by analysis of the degree of variation of lattice parameters by use of the data provided from the present work.,contradiction
One could further measure the axial Young's modulus and shear modulus to revalidate the analytical stress state through self-consistency study.,contradiction
Such complicated yet much more reliable analytical process would better constrain the stress state.,contradiction
"The response of minerals and rock to differential/non-hydrostatic as well as hydrostatic stress is always the focus in geophysics region, such that knowledge of the elastic constants is important for understanding lithospheric flexure, the onset of brittle failure, and the seismic rupture (Turcotte and Schuber, 1982; Aki and Richards, 1980).",contradiction
Non-hydrostatic stress could change the shear modulus of quartz and then may affect its mechanical properties and rupture process.,contradiction
"Quartz, as one of most popular composition of the Crust rock, the effect of non-hydrostatic stress on its elastic properties is significant to understand the process of rock or seismic rupture.",contradiction
The structure and elasticity of quartz under non-hydrostatic and hydrostatic stress were calculated by First-principles method to quantify the effects of non-hydrostatic stress.,contradiction
"Compare to the values at hydrostatic condition, application of ?d affect most of the properties of quartz.",contradiction
"When apply negative ?d along a-axis, the cell parameter, a, volume, V, axial Yong's modulus, Y a and Y b, along with the elastic compliance C11 are all found increased.",contradiction
"The cell parameter c, shear modulus G and elastic compliances C44, C66, and C14, on the other hand, are found to decrease.",contradiction
"When negative ?d is applied along c-direction, the effects differ from those when apply along a-direction.",contradiction
"The parameter c, G, Y a, Y b, along with C11, C44, and C66, are found to increase, and only a, V, along with C14 become smaller.",contradiction
"The ?d does not seem to have much effect on the bulk modulus, K, axial Yong's modulus, Yc, and C12, C13, and C33, no matter what the direction and how much it is.",contradiction
Application of positive ?d along both a and c axis shows opposite effect compared to negative one.,contradiction
"As one of most abundant and indicator mineral for stress inversion of the Crust,by determination of quantified effects of non-hydrostatic stress on crystal and elastic properties of quartz we once more demonstrated its importance and the results would be supportive to exploration of the stress state in the Crust.",contradiction
"Yet the state of non-hydrostatic stress in the Earth is more complex than that reflected by the settings of present work, more works are needed for clear understanding, such as more different state of non-hydrostatic stress and the effect on many more other properties.",contradiction

"Within the CaF6 octahedron, all bond lengths are found to decrease with increasing pressure, and unlike the effect of temperature, where the thermal expansion coefficient of the BX bonds is much less than the AX bonds, the B-site bond compressibilities in KCaF3 are similar to those observed for the A site.",contradiction
"The Ca - F1(1) compressibility at 3.5 GPa (? = 3.4 ž 10?3 GPa?1) is intermediate in value to that observed for the two symmetry independent CaF2 bonds (CaF2(1) ? = 5.2 ž 10?3 GPa?1; CaF2(4) ? = 2.7 ž 10?3 GPa?1), with the range in values encompassing the CaF bond compressibilities observed in the high pressure study of RbCaF3 [24].",contradiction

"The isothermal bulk modulus, 48.2(5) GPa, is consistent with the approximate linear trend of bulk modulus with inverse molar volume in AIBIIF3 perovskite-structured compounds, however the individual polyhedral compressional moduli are seen to be quite dissimilar, as was observed for RbCaF3 [24].",entailment
"The significant differences in the compressibilities of the CaF6 octahedron, and the KF8 polyhedron results in diverging bond valence differences with increasing pressure [52], and on this basis, the structural deformation of KCaF3 should increase with pressure increase.",contradiction

The Polytec PSV-500 is able to measure one-directional surface velocities and thus can capture out-of-plane vibrations.,contradiction
"In the figure, A is the scanning head (PSV-500), B is the reference laser (OFV-505), C is the measured ice sample, and D is the exciter (Alpha Solution AS-1220).",contradiction
"In the scanning head, a laser signal of 670 nm (ñ5 nm (red)) wavelength is directed through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.",contradiction
"Part of the signal is directed to the measured section with scanning mirrors, and part is directed to the photo detector.",contradiction
"The reflected signal from the measured section is compared to the input signal, and from the Doppler frequency shift, the analogue signal proportional to the velocity is produced.",contradiction
The scanning mirrors make it possible to measure several scan points at predefined locations without repositioning the head [17].,contradiction
Fig. 3 illustrates the optical measuring procedure.,contradiction
"SLDV operation is based on the Doppler Effect; therefore, part of the signal directed at the object being measured must be reflected back to the scanning head.",contradiction
"A laser signal is projected at a single point, and the reflected signal is recorded.",contradiction
"Based the difference between the projected and reflected signals, surface velocity can be determined.",contradiction
"The plate ice sample used in this study was relatively non-reflective, so a method was needed to improve the percentage of projected signal that was reflected back to the scanning head.",contradiction
"To enhance the reflectivity of the subject ice sample, both ARDROX reflective spray and ACOUTRONIC retroreflective tape (A-RET-T010) were tested.",contradiction
The reflective spray did not improve reflectivity.,contradiction
The retroreflective tape gave good results.,contradiction
"For this study, the tape was placed on the top surface of the ice to reflect the projected signal.",contradiction
"The additional stiffness added by the tape was negligible compared to the stiffness of the ice plate; therefore, its effect on natural frequency can also be considered negligible.",contradiction
"With this setup, it was possible to record the high frequency vibration of the ice and to determine its natural frequencies.",contradiction
Two traditional excitation methods were tested.,contradiction
The ice sample was excited with an automatic hammer (Alpha Solution AS1220) and a piezo exciter (PI Ceramic P-844.10).,contradiction
"The automatic hammer could not excite the sample ice to sufficiently high frequencies, so the piezo exciter was used for the study.",contradiction
"To approximate its natural frequency regime, an estimate of the ice sample?s first flexural natural frequency was calculated using Eq. (2) with a modulus of elasticity value taken from the literature (8.7 GPa) and a theoretical ice density of 917 kg/m3.",entailment
The calculated result was 3554 Hz.,contradiction
"This predicted natural frequency is high, because the plate ice sample was small (140 ž 105 ž 22 mm) and formed from ultrapure water.",contradiction
The piezo exciter had no problem providing excitation in this frequency range.,contradiction
"To take the measurements in this study, the exciter was set to provide burst chirps from 800 to 10 000 Hz.",contradiction
A burst chirp generates a constant amplitude sine wave signal in the time domain with variable frequency.,contradiction
The piezo exciter was positioned behind and at the middle of the plate ice sample.,contradiction
A three-dimensional geometry was constructed based on the physical dimensions of the plate ice sample.,contradiction
An FEM modal analysis was carried out for the 3D model of the sample.,contradiction
The mesh consisted of 645 solid elements (SOLID186 elements in ANSYS WorkbenchTM).,contradiction
"To model the ice with an isotropic material approach, three properties needed to be defined for the known geometry.",contradiction
"These properties are the modulus of elasticity, i.e., the equivalent stiffness of the material, the density of the material, and Poisson?s ratio.",contradiction
The first two account for a major part of the dynamics.,contradiction
Poisson?s ratio variation had little effect.,contradiction
The value for Poisson?s ratio was taken from the literature.,contradiction
"Because density is known, the modulus of elasticity could be calculated from the model.",contradiction
"In the numerical modal analysis, the first six natural frequencies were rigid body modes with a frequency of 0 Hz and rigid mode shapes.",contradiction
"The higher modes were flexural; representing the ice sample?s internal flexing modes, which were comparable to results obtained with the SLDV measurements.",contradiction
"Since the porosity of the plate ice sample was 8.8%, its density was 837 kg/m3, which is lower than the 917.5 kg/m3 theoretical density published in the literature for pure water ice.",contradiction
"With this density, the calculated mass becomes 247 g.",contradiction
"Given its geometry and this mass, the modulus of elasticity in the numerical model was tuned so the first flexural frequency fell within 10 Hz of that measured.",contradiction

Fig. 8 shows the first flexural mode shapes for PWI #1.,contradiction
The left bottom corner shows the largest amplitude.,contradiction
"Because the largest movement is in the corners, in the future, the retroreflective tapes should be placed closer to the sample edges to improve the mode shape determined from the measurements.",contradiction
The similarity between the measured and calculated mode shapes validate the accuracy of the numerically predicted dynamic behaviors.,contradiction
"The SLDV measures surface velocity in the time domain, and because it is converted to the frequency domain, the natural frequencies show up as higher peaks.",contradiction
Fig. 6 depicts the frequency response of the Pure Water Ice (PWI) sample based on the second set of measurements.,contradiction
Note the higher response peaks corresponding to the natural frequencies.,contradiction
Four measurements were conducted.,contradiction
They were labeled #1 through #4.,contradiction
"The first three were carried out at approximately three-minute intervals, and the fourth was carried out approximately 15 min after the third.",contradiction
"At the time of the measurement #1, the ice sample had been subject to room temperature for 355 s.",contradiction
"For #2, #3, and #4, 549 s, 726 s, and 1680 s, respectively, had elapsed.",contradiction
Natural frequencies up to fifth flexural frequency were considered.,contradiction
Fig. 7 depicts the measured natural frequencies for the four measurements.,contradiction
Modeling the ice sample as an isotropic material yields a lower modulus of elasticity than can be found from the literature.,contradiction
"However, considering its porosity and lower density, the modulus of elasticity should be about 6.9 GPa [15].",entailment
"Given the 6.7 GPa modulus of elasticity used in the numerical model, the first flexural frequency is 0.15% higher than measured (PWI #1) and 0.1% higher with the last measurement (PWI #4).",contradiction
The numerical results for the first five natural frequencies are within +3.5% and ?5.4%.,contradiction
This suggests that even higher flexural frequencies can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.,contradiction
"Comparing the modulus of elasticity to the values found from literature considering that the ice sample included porosity, the measurement procedure was conducted at 22 øC, and the geometry was approximate, the difference seems reasonable.",contradiction
The analytical results estimated an 11.7% higher natural frequency for the first measurement (PWI #1) and a 5.0% higher natural frequency for the last measurement (PWI #4) when compared to the measured results.,contradiction
"To perform the analytical calculation, the geometry was considered rectangular.",contradiction
This simplification resulted in inaccurate estimates for the higher flexural modes.,contradiction
"Nonetheless, the analytical equation gave a useful rough estimate of where to expect the first flexural frequency.",contradiction
The SLDV proved capable of capturing the natural frequencies of the ice sample.,contradiction
"As the plate ice sample melted, its natural frequencies dropped.",contradiction
The rate of natural frequency drop-off was visibly consistent with the measurements results.,contradiction
The measured natural frequency drop-off as a function of ice volume seemed to be linear.,contradiction
Measurements were conducted at room temperature.,contradiction
The retroreflective tape used to enhance reflected signals remained in place even as the plate ice sampled melted.,contradiction
It was held via the surface tension of the liquid water on the ice?s surface.,contradiction
"To conduct similar measurement at subzero temperatures, a different means of attached the retroreflective tape will be needed.",contradiction
"For example, the tape could be frozen to the ice using water as was done in 7.",contradiction
This research employed the SLDV optical method to evaluate the natural frequencies and elastic modulus of plate ice.,contradiction
This information can be used to prepare a structural model and use it to analyze ice dynamic behaviors.,contradiction
The study showed that the SLDV consistently and accurately estimated the natural frequencies of the sample ice.,contradiction
"It also revealed that to get a good signal to the scanning head, enhancing the reflectivity of the ice surface is necessary.",contradiction
Retroreflective tape was used.,contradiction
"In addition, because the plate ice sample measured was small, its lowest flexural frequencies were over 2800 Hz.",contradiction
A piezo exciter was needed to generate these higher frequency excitations.,contradiction
"Burst chirps from 800 to 10,000 Hz were used.",contradiction
"In the future, it would be interesting to study the effect of the ice?s crystalline structure on its natural frequencies.",contradiction

The resulting density profile also shows just ?0.2% higher density.,contradiction
"To sum up, we infer that if the thermal expansion coefficient at zero-pressure is treated as a constant in the P-V-T data analysis of hydrous pyrope, it may lead to very limited uncertainty in the extrapolated density profile of hydrous pyrope in the Earth?s upper mantle region.",contradiction
"Furthermore, the density profiles of olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene were also modeled using existing results on their thermoelasticity parameters (Suzuki and Anderson, 1983; Guyot et al., 1996; Zhao et al., 1995, 1998; Shinmei et al., 1999; Nishihara et al., 2003; Liu and Li, 2006; Lu et al., 2013; Huang and Chen, 2014).",contradiction

"From Fig. 10, the pyrolite model with all Fe-bearing minerals shows the largest density profile; whereas using the hydrous pyrope instead of the anhydrous Fe-bearing pyrope meant the modeled pyrolite with hydrous pyrope and other Fe-bearing minerals showed a lower density profile than the pyrolite model with all Fe-bearing minerals towards the PREM density profile (Fig. 10).",contradiction
"Furthermore, considering that the volume proportion of pyrope in the pyrolite model is relatively small compared with olivine and pyroxene, incorporating water into the olivine and pyroxene of the upper mantle may make the density profiles of the pyrolite model match the PREM density profile well.",contradiction
"This once again proves that the nominally anhydrous mineral phases in the Earth?s upper mantle (olivine, pyroxene, and garnet) can contain a significant amount of hydrogen.",contradiction

Pressures were determined from the derived cell volumes of Au based on its equation of state (EOS) [64] (Fig. 3 a).,contradiction
The uncertainties of the determined pressures are due to the propagation of errors associated with Au cell volumes.,contradiction

"Moreover, there is no emergence or disappearance of diffraction peaks on increasing pressure to ?40 GPa, suggesting that U3Si2 undergoes no discernible phase transitions.",contradiction
"The elastic prosperities of U3Si2 can be determined by analyzing the pressure-dependent structural data, especially lattice parameters.",contradiction
"The unit cell volume?pressure relation can be fitted by the second order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state [65]:(1)P=3K02[(V0V)73?(V0V)53]{1+34(K0'?4)[(V0V)23?1]}where V 0 is the zero-pressure cell volume, V is the cell volume at a given pressure P, K 0 is bulk modulus, and K0' is the pressure derivative of K 0, which is fixed at 4 [65].",contradiction

"The derived K 0 value is much larger than that determined by RUS (68.3 GPa) [19], but is in general agreement with the DFT-derived value, 92.01 GPa [5].",contradiction
"The smaller value from RUS is probably a result of sample-dependent bulk characteristics, such as weight, impurity, porosity, and symmetrical shape, which can all contribute to the underestimation [19,47].",contradiction
"On the other hand, the RUS result is of practical interest, as it reflects the engineering modulus of U3Si2 materials from scaled-up fabrication whose microstructural defects and compositional variances cannot be effectively eliminated.",contradiction
"However, even though the method for obtaining K 0 in this work is immune to deviations caused by sample preparation or bulk defects, its accuracy still depends on the confidence of the determined pressures, the (quasi-)hydrostaticity during compression or decompression, and the quality of the obtained high-pressure XRD data.",contradiction
"One way to check the quality of the fitted EOS is to compare the derived bulk modulus with that obtained by linear moduli through the relation [62] K0,lm=3?(1Ma,0+1Ma,0+1Mc,0)?1, where Ma,0 and Mc,0 are the linear moduli along the a- and c-axis, respectively, which define the linear compressibility at zero pressure.",contradiction
"Similar to the volume?pressure relation, variations of unit cell parameters with pressure can be fitted to the one-dimensional analog of the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state [39] (Fig. 4) by replacing V in equation (1) with a 3 or c 3:(2)P=3Ma,02[(a0a)7?(a0a)5],P=3Mc,02[(c0c)7?(c0c)5],where a0 and c0 are unit-cell parameters at zero pressure.",contradiction

"Note that the linear modulus along the c-axis is ?2.4 times that along the a-axis, suggesting that the structure is less compressible along the c-axis.",contradiction
"Such anisotropic compressibility is evident in Fig. 4, where the rate of contraction in the relative c value is smaller than that in a, with a decelerating trend at higher pressures.",contradiction
The anisotropic behavior in axial compressibility can be explained by the susceptibility of various bond distances to compression (Fig. 5 ).,contradiction

These bonding parameters are in accordance with experimental [59] and theoretical [5] values.,contradiction
"With increasing pressure, the in-plane bonds that is perpendicular to the c-axis behave differently from those out-plane bonds parallel to the c-axis.",contradiction
"As seen from Fig. 5, all the three in-plane bonds U1?Si, Si?Si, and U2?U2 exhibit larger changes upon compression; compared to their values at 2 GPa, they contract by 6%?11% at 30 GPa.",contradiction
"On the other hand, the bond interactions along the c-axis are more resistant to compression, as reflected by the relatively small changes in the projected distances of diagonal bonding interactions (U2 and other atoms) along the c-axis; these interatomic distances contract only by 4%?7% when pressure increases from 2 GPa to 30 GPa.",contradiction

"Poisson's ratio ?, which describes the extent of transverse strains over longitudinal strains, reflects the packing density of atoms and thus is intimately connected to their bonding characteristics [68,69].",contradiction
"Ionic bonds usually provide more dense packing that results in higher values of ? (?0.25), whereas covalent solids with less dense packing have lower values of ? (?0.1) [68,70].",contradiction
"Therefore, both our DAC and previous DFT studies suggest that the U3Si2 structure is dominated by ionic contributions from three different U?Si bonds, which is consistent with the brittle nature (K/G = 1.58) of U3Si2 [69].",contradiction

The volume of the B19 CuZr structure is larger compared with that of the B2 CuZr structure.,contradiction
This implies that the martensitic transformation from the B2 to B19 structure is associated with a volume change which can affect the stress state in the matrix.,contradiction
"Moreover, the volume decreasing trajectory of the B2 CuZr structure is less pronounced towards high pressures, as shown in Fig. 2 .",contradiction

"Moreover, there is a pseudogap at F E due to strong hybridization between Cu and Zr proved by the peaks of Cu-d and Zr-d (as shown in Fig. 4).",contradiction
This means that the B2 CuZr compound has metallic conductivity.,contradiction
"Interestingly, the values of the total density of states at the Fermi level decrease with increasing pressure, suggesting that the hybridization between the electronic orbitals of the atoms becomes stronger.",contradiction
"This result can be evidenced once again by the Mulliken populations and bond lengths of the Zr-Cu bonds for the B2 CuZr structure with respect to pressure, as show in Table 2 .",contradiction

"This can be attributed to the deviation of the elastic constants at different directions, as shown in Table 3, i.e. the anisotropy factor ? (? = 2C 44/(C 11 -C 12) of the B2 CuZr structure increases from 2.99 at 0 GPa to 7.99 for a pressure of 30 GPa.",contradiction
The large anisotropy factor ? implies a strong elastic anisotropy.,contradiction
"Moreover, the E contours of the B2 CuZr structure are highly distorted along the [0 0 1] direction and less polarized at the (1 0 0) crystal plane.",contradiction
"More detailed information for the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) crystallographic planes can be obtained from the planar projections of Young's modulus, as shown in Fig. 6 .",contradiction
The directional dependences of E for the cubic CuZr structure under different pressure can be clearly observed.,contradiction
"In Fig. 6 (a), the E at the (1 1 0) plane shows a strong anisotropy.",contradiction
"However, the calculated planar contours of E at the (1 0 0) crystallographic planes exhibit relatively weak anisotropic properties, as shown in Fig. 6 (b).",contradiction
"Interestingly, the cubic CuZr structures at different pressure reveal that the maximum Young's moduli deviate from the axis.",contradiction
"Moreover, the anisotropy in E of the B2 CuZr structure at high pressure is more remarkable than that at low pressure.",contradiction
The variation of the elastic anisotropy is well consistent with the strong bonding tendency between Cu atoms and Zr atoms in the B2 CuZr structure under high pressure.,contradiction
Fig. 7 shows the planar projections of the Young's modulus of the B19 CuZr structure at (1 0 0) and (0 0 1) crystallographic planes.,contradiction
"E at the (1 1 0) crystallographic planes exhibits relatively weak anisotropic properties compared with that at (0 0 1) crystallographic planes, (see Fig. 7(a) and (b) for comparison).",contradiction
"Interestingly, the B19 CuZr structure at different pressure shows that the maximum Young's moduli do not deviate from the axis, which is obviously different from what was found for the cubic CuZr structure.",contradiction

"The pure transverse and longitudinal modes in a cubic system can be expressed by:(16)[100]vl=C11?[010]vt1=[001]vt2=C44?,[110]vl=C11+C12+2C442?[11?0]vt1=C11?C12?,[001]vt2=C44?,[111]vl=C11+2C12+4C443?[112?]vt1=[112?]vt2=C11?C12+C443?

"The Debye temperature ? reflects the thermodynamic properties of a solid and can be estimated by the following equation based on evaluation of the elastic constants [19]:(18)?=?k[3n4?(NA?M)]13vm,where h represents Planck's constant, and N A and M are the Avogadro number and the molecular weight, respectively.",contradiction
"The longitudinal, transverse and average sound velocities, v l, v t and v m can be obtained from Navier's equation [19]:(19)vm=[13(2vt3+1vl3)]?13vl=[(B+4G3)/?]12vt=(G?)12.",contradiction
"The calculated results of v l, v t, v m and ? of B2 and B19 CuZr structures under different hydrostatic pressures are summarized in Table 6 .",contradiction
"It is obvious that the sound velocities and ? of both B2 and B19 CuZr structures increase monotonically with increasing pressure, i.e. v m and ? of the B2 CuZr structure reach up to 2464 m/s and 284 K, respectively, for a pressure of 30 GPa compared with 2228 m/s and 257 K for a pressure of 0 GPa.",contradiction
"For the B19 CuZr structure v m and ? increased from 2300 m/s and 265 K at 0 GPa to 2750 m/s and 317 K at 30 GPa, respectively.",contradiction
"As is well known, the larger ?, the stronger is the interatomic bonding.",contradiction
The variations of ? verify the bonding tendency between Cu and Zr in the B2 and B19 CuZr structures under high pressure.,contradiction
"Since ? of the B19 CuZr structure at different pressure is higher than that of the B2 CuZr structure, this also means that the B19 structure has a larger thermal conductivity.",contradiction
"We gained a better insight into the structural transformation of CuZr precipitates, the intrinsic properties of both B2 cubic (CsCl-type) CuZr and B19 (?-AuCd -type) CuZr structures under hydrostatic pressures up to 30 GPa, i.e., the stabilities, the anisotropic elastic and thermodynamic properties, were investigated by first principles calculations.",contradiction
The calculated C ij values of the B2 CuZr structure agree well with experimental data.,contradiction
"The results show that the Young's modulus, bulk modulus and shear modulus increase significantly with increasing pressure.",contradiction
"Noticeably, under hydrostatic pressure, the B2 CuZr crystalline phase shows a stronger anisotropy along the (1 1 0) plane than for the (1 0 0) plane for pressures up to 30 GPa.",contradiction
"Under high pressure, the stability of the B2 CuZr structure decreases while the Helmholtz free energy and the formation enthalpy increase monotonically.",contradiction
"Moreover, the stability of the B19 CuZr phase decreases with increasing pressure.",contradiction
The decreasing stability of both B2 and B19 CuZr structures and the different stability decreasing trajectories result in a high propensity of martensitic transformation from the B2 to B19 structure.,contradiction
Our results may have implications for better understanding the phase stability of B2 and B19 CuZr structures under high pressure and can shed light on the structure-property relationships of BMG composites reinforced with shape-memory crystals.,contradiction
Pressure agglomeration with roller compactors is commonly used to improve the flowability of powders and to reduce dustiness.,contradiction
"It is applied in many industries since the end of the 19th century, such as coal processing, soda ash, potash, calcined lime and magnesium oxide industries [1].",contradiction
"More recently, the focus has been on pharmaceutical applications [2].",contradiction
"In the food and beverage industry, roller compaction is used to produce consumer friendly products which have the right mix of ingredients and are easy to dispense [3].",contradiction
"Compaction is also used in food and pharmaceutical applications as cost effective solution to encapsulate flavour compounds or sensitive nutrients [4,5].",contradiction
"The advantage of using pressure to form agglomerates is that a liquid binder is not required to create bonds between the particles and therefore, the process is dry.",contradiction
"This reduces the cost substantially compared to growth agglomeration processes, such as fluidized bed agglomeration.",contradiction
"Drying of the material is not required, which saves considerable amounts of energy.",contradiction
"However, to form mechanically stable agglomerates, the process must apply high stress to bond the powder particles together.",contradiction
Agglomerates formed through pressure agglomeration tend to have physical characteristics such as high density and strength as well as low porosity.,contradiction
"These structural aspects influence the functional properties of the final products, such as dissolution time.",contradiction
"Often there is a trade-off between a product being able to resist breakage during handling, packaging and transport and one which will dissolve instantly, in line with the consumers' expectations.",contradiction
"Roller compaction is used for the agglomeration of various food products, such as sucrose, sodium chloride (bakery spread-salt), vitamins and supplements, fibres used as food ingredients, soup and seasoning powders, monosodium glutamate, encapsulated flavour powders and dairy powders.",contradiction
"Roller compaction is typically operated as a continuous process, making it very efficient for products with large throughput.",contradiction
"For food materials, roller compactors with a throughput of up to 150 t/d are used.",contradiction
Food powders are typically agglomerated to a final particle size of 0.2 to 3 mm by applying a line pressure of up to 500 MPa [6].,contradiction
The concept of roller compaction processes is to pass powder between two counter rotating rollers which apply pressure to the material as it moves between them.,contradiction
The powder is encouraged to flow through the gap by the friction acting at the surfaces of the rolls.,contradiction
"The powder can be fed to the rollers either by gravity, or using a screw feeder.",contradiction
The screw feeding system aids de-aeration of the material which can inhibit powder compaction as well as supplying a constant flow of material to the rollers to maintain a fixed gap size.,contradiction
This enables the system to apply a constant stress to the material and therefore produce consistent ribbons and granules in terms of strength and porosity.,contradiction
"Due to the applied pressure from the rollers a continuous dense ribbon is formed, which is then passed on to a size reduction step where it is milled down into the required granule size.",contradiction
"In a continuous sieving step the target granule size fraction is separated from fines, which are recycled to the feed, and oversized particles, which go back to the mill.",contradiction
"The combination of compactor gap size, crusher size and sieve mesh size needs to be optimized in order to obtain a product with good size uniformity and high throughput [6?10].",contradiction
"In the literature, detailed investigations on stress regimes applied in roller compaction can be found [7,8,11?13].",contradiction
"The process is usually described as passing the powder through three regions: the slip, nip and release regions.",contradiction
The end of the slip region and the start of the nip region are identified by the nip angle.,contradiction
At this point there is little or no relative movement between the feed material and the rollers.,contradiction
Material densification occurs as it is moved through the region where the gap width between the rollers gradually becomes smaller and the normal stress increases.,contradiction
The point at which the gap width is smallest when the nip angle is zero.,contradiction
It is usually the point at which the maximum normal stress applied to the material occurs.,contradiction
"In food systems two basic supra-molecular structures are found: amorphous systems, in which only short range orders can be observed in the molecular arrangement, and crystalline structures, in which the atoms or molecules are highly ordered according to a lattice structure.",contradiction
Molecular mobility within crystalline or amorphous structures can be expressed as free volume vf available for the motion of the molecules.,contradiction
"When increasing the temperature, the free volume within crystalline and amorphous structures increases differently, as described by Palzer [14].",contradiction
"By heating a crystalline system, the molecules increasingly vibrate at their lattice position, until the crystalline structure breaks down at a defined temperature called the melting point.",contradiction
"By heating an amorphous glass, the free volume increases steadily.",contradiction
Above a certain temperature the gradient with which the free volume increases changes significantly.,contradiction
Molecule clusters are set free and start to rotate and slip past each other.,contradiction
The onset of this temperature interval is commonly defined as glass transition temperature Tg .,contradiction
"Moisture has a dominant effect on adhesion forces between food particles, which are physically characterized by their hygrocapacity (e.g. their ability to bind water into the molecular matrix) and by their hygrosensitivity (e.g. the extent to which their mechanical properties change when they absorb water).",contradiction
The sorption isotherm describes the relation between water content w and water activity a w at a given temperature.,contradiction
"As emphasized by Palzer [14], the hygrocapacity of amorphous substances is higher than the one of crystalline materials.",contradiction
"Below a critical relative humidity (also known as deliquescence point) leading to dissolution of the crystalline substance, water can only be stored in the crystal matrix in the form of crystal water.",contradiction
Amorphous hydrophilic substances absorb increasing amounts of water with increasing relative humidity.,contradiction
"With increasing water content, the viscosity of the amorphous melt decreases, and finally a solution is obtained.",contradiction
Amorphous and crystalline substances also demonstrate significantly different hygrosensitivity.,contradiction
Crystalline substances preserve their mechanical properties with increasing humidity or temperature until they dissolve.,contradiction
"The resulting solution has in most cases a low viscosity, due to their low molecular weight.",contradiction
"Amorphous materials already have a liquid-like supra-molecular structure, although they are perceived as solids.",contradiction
Water migrating into the amorphous molecular matrix has a plasticizing effect on the structure [15].,contradiction
Viscosity and elasticity of the material decrease with increasing water content and temperature.,contradiction
Changes in mechanical material properties linked to moisture content and temperature variations have a strong influence on the performance of roller compaction processes involving amorphous food particles.,contradiction
"In comparison to most applications in minerals processing (where inorganic compounds are compacted) and in the pharmaceutical industry (where mostly crystalline carriers and excipients are used), the compaction of amorphous food particles brings specific challenges.",contradiction
An overview on moisture-dependent deformation and adhesion mechanisms of amorphous food particles is given in [16].,contradiction
"As introduced in the previous section, the mechanical material properties and their sensitivity to moisture and temperature play a significant role in how the compaction process will perform.",contradiction
"Material properties that are likely to influence the quality of the ribbon being produced are the compressibility, particle size of the material, and the glass transition temperature.",contradiction
"All of these will affect the feeding of the bulk powder to the rollers, which is often the main source of process stability issues.",contradiction
"Fine and cohesive powders are likely to have poor flowability, which makes them more susceptible to feeding issues.",contradiction
"Materials with a high compressibility can become packed in the feeding zone, causing blockages.",contradiction
The strength of the agglomerates formed is very much dependent on how the powder particles bond together.,contradiction
"Due to the high stresses and no binder present in roller compaction, this is usually due to deformation of the material.",contradiction
Deformation causes strong Van der Waal forces due to a decreasing distance and increase contacting area between particles.,contradiction
"It can also cause sintering, where solid material bonds grow between the particles due to decreasing material viscosity [6].",contradiction
This is caused by temperature increases due to friction and high localised stresses [17].,contradiction
"Amorphous food materials are especially susceptible to sintering due to their low glass transition temperatures, causing them to enter into their rubbery state.",contradiction
"However, it is also possible with crystalline materials depending on the stress applied.",contradiction
"Moisture can locally dissolve crystalline surfaces and recrystallize upon decompression, forming solid material bridges between particles.",contradiction
Fig. 1 shows SEM images of sodium chloride and maltodextrin DE21 ribbons showing evidence of particle sintering.,contradiction
"For the maltodextrin ribbon (Fig. 1b), individual particles are no longer distinguishable, as it has become one uniform material.",contradiction
The variability of the mechanical properties of amorphous materials also offers potential to optimize the compaction process with respect to the required stress levels and energy input in order to achieve a desired product structure.,contradiction
Facilitated flow of the plasticised material under pressure and friction-induced increases of the product temperature influence the dominant bonding mechanism and determine the structure of the compacted ribbons [17].,contradiction
"Controlling these factors allows the formation of food particle compacts with desired porosity, density and, ultimately, a targeted reconstitution performance.",contradiction
"In tabletting, the effect of water content on the compressibility of amorphous materials and the properties of the tablets formed has been studied previously.",contradiction
Li and Peck [18] and Ollet et al. [19] showed that increasing the water content affected the compression behaviour of amorphous food materials and that increasing amounts of water increased plastic deformation.,contradiction
"Sebhatu et al. [20] demonstrated with amorphous lactose exhibiting increasing deformability with increasing water content that an increase in plastic deformation will increase the bonding area between particles, therefore increase the strength of tablets.",contradiction
"However, Sun [21] showed that increasing the amounts of water will decrease the bonding strength between particles.",contradiction
"The final strength of the tablet was, therefore, suggested to be a trade-off between bonding area; increasing with increasing water content, and bonding strength; decreasing with increasing water content [22,23].",contradiction
"For roller compaction, Osborne et al. [17] linked moisture content and applied hydraulic pressure to structural aspects such as the ribbon porosity.",contradiction
"Increasing moisture and pressure both decrease the glass transition temperature of the compacted amorphous matrix, which facilitates viscous flow and therefore produces denser and stronger ribbons.",contradiction
Mitchell et al. [24] describe the combined effect of material properties and process parameters on the reconstitution properties of powder compacts.,contradiction
"They conclude that despite a dominant influence of water temperature and material molecular weight, increasing the tablet porosity clearly improves reconstitution kinetics.",contradiction
"They suggest that porosity influences the dissolution regime, whereas stronger bridges formed between particles resist disintegration and dissolution.",contradiction
The objective of this contribution is to introduce the notion of process-structure-property relationships for roller compaction of amorphous particles.,contradiction
"Emphasis is put on the structure of the compacted granules, as central characteristic linking functionality and product quality criteria (such as flowability, stability and reconstitution kinetics) to the initial material properties and applied process conditions (such as glass transition temperature and compaction pressure).",contradiction
This work introduces the bonding regime map for roller compaction of amorphous materials.,contradiction
"It frames the operational conditions and predicts the resulting product structure, which determines final product performance characteristics.",contradiction
Mastering the product structure allows prediction of its functionality.,contradiction
"In order to assess the dissolution kinetics of compacted food particles, a conductivity-based method was used.",contradiction
A portion of 5 g of compacted food powder is released onto 400 mL of demineralized water at 80 øC under intense stirring.,contradiction
Release of ions from the dissolved food powder into the water phase results in an increase of the electrical conductivity of the medium.,contradiction
"The output of the measurement is a characteristic time called t90, corresponding to the required time to reach 90% of the final conductivity value.",contradiction
"Alternatively, for non-polar materials such as sugars and dextrose syrup, the refractive index of the solution is used to measure the reconstitution kinetics.",contradiction
"A FISO FTI-10 universal instrument (FISO technologies, Quebec, Canada) equipped with fiber optic transducers was used to perform refractive index measurements.",contradiction
Calibration curves with different sugars at different temperatures were recorded to relate the solute concentration to the measured refractive index.,contradiction
"Lab scale compaction trials have been performed at the University of Sheffield, on an Alexanderwerk WP120 (Alexanderwerk, Germany) device.",contradiction
The WP120 is a horizontally screw fed roller compactor that uses side cheeks to prevent the powder from leaking between the rollers during compression.,contradiction
"It is also fitted with a vacuum de-aeration system which sucks air out of the system prior to entry into the rollers and, therefore, enhances consolidation of the powder.",contradiction
Pilot scale trials were performed at Nestle? NPTC Singen on a Hosokawa Bepex line.,contradiction
"Amorphous dextrose syrup (DE21, Roquette SA, Lestrem, France) was used as model food material.",contradiction
"Dextrose syrup DE21 was analyzed by Roos and Karel [25] and Descamps et al. [26], who report the glass transition temperature as a function of the moisture content, varying between 90 øC at 3% moisture content and 30 øC at 10% moisture content.",contradiction
Commercial beverage powders were used to apply findings from model materials to amorphous food powders from Nestle?'s product portfolio.,contradiction
The bulk density of feed powders and compacted food products was measured according to the ISO 8460 standard method.,contradiction
"The envelope density of powder particles was characterized with the Geopyc 1365 (Micromeritics, Norcross, USA).",contradiction
"Fine silica powder (DryFlo, d4,3 = 150 ?m) was used to fill the interstitial voids between the particles of interest for the analysis.",contradiction
"This method, also known as powder pycnometry, characterizes the density of product particles including closed and open pores (and potentially surface roughness).",contradiction
"Under the assumption that the bulk packing of the product particles is not affected by introducing silica powder, the envelope density and the bulk density are correlated.",contradiction
"For non-porous materials, the envelope density is equal to the core material density.",contradiction
The fragility or friability of compacted food powders was assessed by sieving.,contradiction
"A Retsch AS200 sifter (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) was used to assess if particles are more or less fragile, according to the following protocol: Sieve 100 g of powder on a 630 ?m sieve during 1 min at a vibration amplitude of 1 mm and collect and weigh the top fraction.",contradiction
Sieve the top fraction (particles > 630 ?m) on the same sieve during 2 min at amplitude of 3 mm and collect and weigh the bottom fraction.,contradiction
"This intense shaking breaks particles, if they are fragile.",contradiction
Calculate the percentage of broken particles (particles < 630 ?m) to obtain what we call the ?fragility?.,contradiction
The particle size of compacted food powders was evaluated with the Occhio Zephyr ESR (Occhio SA.,contradiction
"Angleur, Belgium).",contradiction
Determination of particle size parameters is performed using imaging of falling particles in front of a video camera.,contradiction
"Main considered parameters are mean volume diameter d 4, 3; diameters d 10, d 50 and d 90 such respectively 10%, 50% or 90% of the volume of particles is smaller than the considered diameter; or the span s = (d 90 ? d 10)/d 50.",contradiction
Roller compaction trials were carried out in Sheffield University to investigate the effect of varying the normal stress applied to the powder and the powder moisture content [17].,contradiction
Amorphous dextrose syrup (DE21) was used as model food material.,contradiction
"From the subsequent results a bonding regime map for roller compaction of amorphous materials was developed, shown in Fig. 3 .",contradiction
"This regime map indicates the dominant adhesion principle, such as Van der Waals forces, micro-sintering or sintering, as a function of the difference between process temperature and glass transition temperature (Tg ? T) and the applied normal stress during compaction.",contradiction
The main criterion for a regime change is the porous structure of the formed ribbons.,contradiction
"If no sintering occurs due to low applied stress and/or the material being in a glassy state far below Tg, ribbon porosities between 50 and 20% are obtained.",contradiction
"At a porosity of 20% the onset of micro-sintering was observed, which is indicated by a fitting line in the regime map.",contradiction
The micro-sintering line was extended to intercept zero on both the X and Y-axis as this is the glass transition temperature where the material will begin to sinter even when no external normal stress is applied to it.,contradiction
"Macroscopic sintering to the point where individual particles can no longer be identified occurs in the third region of the map, characterized by ribbon porosities lower than 5%.",contradiction
The line labelled Tg signifies the point at which the temperature of the powder will surpass its glass transition temperature.,contradiction
"A final line, labelled Van der Waals, signifies the point at which interparticulate forces, such as Van der Waals forces, cause particles to adhere to create an agglomerate/ribbon.",contradiction
"This map is a valuable tool for scale-up and development of roller compaction processes involving food powders, as it frames the operational conditions and predicts the resulting product structure.",contradiction
"Using parameters that are not specific to the material and the equipment geometry to define the axes, it can be expected that the map has predictive capabilities for other machines and other materials than dextrose syrup DE21 which was used in this study.",contradiction
"The onset of micro-sintering and sintering regimes, here observed at 20% and 5% residual porosity, respectively, may vary, however, as a function of the compacted material.",contradiction
Controlling structural attributes of compacted beverage powders to drive their functionality.,contradiction
"Once the relationships between material characteristics, process conditions and the resulting structure of compacted amorphous materials are understood, product developers can optimize the final product properties and performance building on scientific understanding of the process-structure-property relationships [33?35].",contradiction
Key properties related to product quality and performance in food and beverage products are: fragility/hardness of tablets and dissolution time of beverage powders.,contradiction
"Structural attributes with dominant influence on these product properties are: Primary particle bonding mechanism, compacted particle size distribution, bulk density/envelope density of compacted particles and porosity of compacted particles.",contradiction
"Process conditions and raw material attributes that influence the formation of these structures are: Initial powder bulk density and particle size, moisture content, difference between process temperature and glass transition temperature and compaction stress level.Example 1Controlling particle fragility.",contradiction
"Breakage of the compacted granules during filling, transportation and consumer handling is perceived as defect in most beverage products and might negatively impact the dosing accuracy for example in vending machine applications.",contradiction
Particle segregation and dust should generally be avoided.,contradiction
"Therefore, the fragility measure is an important quality criterion.",contradiction
"In the present study, the fragility of compacted beverage powder granules was related to the structure of the compacted ribbons.",contradiction
"As shown in Fig. 4 , the measured fragility is strongly correlated to the porosity of the granules.",contradiction
"The higher the ribbon porosity, the looser assembled is the compacted structure, which results in higher fragility values.",contradiction
The porosity is proportional to the compacted powder bulk density.,contradiction
X-ray tomographic images of two exemplary granule samples are shown in Fig. 5 .,contradiction
The central slice of a cube with 3 mm side length is represented in the figures.,contradiction
"Whereas the dense particle packing of the ribbon at 20% porosity (Fig. 5a) clearly suggest that sintering of the particles has occurred, the looser structure of the ribbon with 35% porosity (Fig. 5b) still reveals the primary particle structure (d4,3 = 150 ?m).",contradiction
"To position this compaction process on the bonding regime map, the ribbon outlet temperature after the compactor was measured with an infrared thermometer.",contradiction
"Accounting for the accuracy of this quick detection method, the operation took place in a range of (Tg ? T) = 10?20 K.",contradiction
The resulting point of operation is indicated by the blue box in the process regime map (see Fig. 6 ).,contradiction
"Based on this result, the operational conditions (i.e. moisture content of the particles and compaction pressure) of subsequent compaction trials can be optimized with respect to the required stability of the product.",contradiction
"(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Example 2Controlling dissolution kinetics.",contradiction
The dissolution time of compacted beverage powders was found to be well correlated to the granule size and porosity.,contradiction
"While the dissolution time of highly porous agglomerated beverage powders (d4,3 = 1 mm, particle porosity = 70%) is around t90 = 1 s, the compacted beverage powder (particle porosity = 30%) exhibits t90 values in the range between 3 s and 10 s, depending on the particle size.",contradiction
Results regarding the dissolution time as a function of particle size are shown in Fig. 7a.,contradiction
"Radial dissolution of the compacted beverage powder granules can be expected, due to their low open porosity.",contradiction
"Assuming a spherical particle shape, the dissolution kinetic can be modelled according to Eq. (1), where r0 represents the particle radius and the parameter vd is the average radial dissolution speed.",contradiction
"The dynamic evolution of the conductivity ?(t) is obtained by integrating overall size fractions.(1)?t??PSDr0,i3?r0,i?vdt3 A good agreement between the data and the model is obtained, as shown in Fig. 7b.",contradiction
"For the analyzed beverage powder we obtain the value vd = 36 ñ 8 ?m/s for the defined reconstitution conditions according to the test method (80 øC, stirring at 500 rpm).",contradiction
"Although the particle size predominantly influences the reconstitution kinetics of compacted granules, their composition and structure also play an important role.",contradiction
"Independent of the applied equipment or specific process parameters, the reconstitution performance of granules made by roller compaction can be related to their structure, such as the granule porosity.",contradiction
This is shown in Fig. 8 for beverage powder granules.,contradiction
A trend can be seen that porous granules dissolve faster.,contradiction
"The driver for this functionality is the granule structure, which determines wetting and impregnation with water.",contradiction
Porous particles take up water more rapidly.,contradiction
"This functionality is not directly resulting from the applied compaction pressure, since very different granule structures can be obtained at identical pressure depending on whether the compaction conditions are close to the glass transition temperature of the material or not.",contradiction
"In the investigated case, both beverage powders were compacted at temperatures in a range of T ? Tg = 10?20 K.",contradiction
"Besides the effect of the granule structure, the relation between dissolution time and granule porosity is dependent on the product composition.",contradiction
"Here, beverage powder A dissolves significantly slower than beverage powder B at the same granule porosity.",contradiction
"This finding can be related to differences in the texture of the initial powder before compaction and to the hydrocarbon composition of both products, which impacts the viscosity build up as water penetrates into the granule and hence affects the dissolution time.",contradiction
"As the mechanical properties of the hygrosensitive amorphous materials are changing as a function of the moisture content, the impact moisture on the tableting process was investigated using amorphous dextrose syrup (DE21) as model food material.",contradiction
A double punch rotary press was used to compress the powder samples of variable moisture content into tablets.,contradiction
The resulting pressure cycles are shown in Fig. 2 .,contradiction
In all cases the pressure increases initially as the piston of the press mounts on the compression roller and decreases again after passing the highest point of the roller.,contradiction
"Interestingly, the observed pressure cycles strongly depend on the visco-elastic properties of the material and on the compression parameters.",contradiction
All results shown in Fig. 2 represent trials that delivered a constant tensile strength of the tablets of 1.2?1.3 MPa.,contradiction
"While at low moisture content a pressure of 70?80 MPa is required for producing tablets with a tensile strength of 1.2 MPa, at high moisture content a pressure of 25?30 MPa is sufficient.",contradiction
On the right hand side of Fig. 2 the maximum required pressure and the corresponding elastic re-expansion of the tablet are shown as a function of the difference between the glass transition and the temperature of the used base powder.,contradiction
"Again, all results shown correspond to tablets with a tensile strength of 1.2?1.3 MPa.",contradiction
"With increasing difference between the glass transition - driven by lower moisture content of the powder - and powder temperature when subjected to the tabletting trial, both the required pressure and the elastic re-expansion increase significantly.",contradiction
This can be explained by the effect that both the viscosity and the elastic modulus of the amorphous dextrose syrup increase with increasing magnitude of difference from the glass transition temperature.,contradiction
"Furthermore, due to the reduced elasticity and re-expansion of a humid powder compact placed in the tablet press, the pressure will decrease faster, when tableting humid powders compared to dry powders, which has strong implications on subsequent filling and packaging lines.",contradiction
"Compaction pressure and re-expansion data in Fig. 2 are taken from separate trial sets, both using the same press, but with dextrose syrup DE21 equilibrated at different water activity.",contradiction
"Therefore, the points on the compaction pressure and re-expansion curves do not always coincide at the same values of T ? Tg.",contradiction
The obtained results suggest that an increasing moisture content of the amorphous base facilitates the deformation of particles during compression and can potentially reduce the required compaction pressure significantly.,contradiction
"In many food powder applications, however, the possibility to increase the moisture content of the powder is limited by caking tendencies of the powder during feeding of the press, stickiness of the powder on the surface of the punches and by the required shelf-life of the produced tablets [6,27?32].",contradiction
"For consumers of compacted food products, such as bouillon cubes or compacted beverage powders, strength and stability are prerequisites that ensure the product arrives in the expected shape, size and hardness until it is used.",contradiction
"Beyond that, consumers expect functional properties such as crumbliness or instant reconstitution properties, which are predominantly controlled by the compact structure.",contradiction
"Despite the apparent simplicity of the process and building on 150 years of industrial experience with roller compaction, amorphous food materials and their specific material properties still present challenges to compaction processes today.",contradiction
"Building on scientific understanding of the glass transition of amorphous materials, opportunities arise to optimize these processes.",contradiction
During tableting of food products the applied compaction pressure and the resulting energy requirements may be reduced by conditioning the powder at higher water activity.,contradiction
"The bonding regime map for roller compaction of amorphous powders is introduced, allowing process conditions and material characteristics to be related to the structure and mechanical properties of the compacted ribbon.",contradiction
"With this knowledge, product developers are now able to predict the functionality of a final product, successfully applying the concept of process-structure-property relationships.",contradiction
"Using commercial beverage powders is was shown how the final product performance characteristics like granule fragility or dissolution kinetics are correlated to structural parameters such as density, porosity and particle size distribution, which are driven via the process and feed material properties.",contradiction
Mastering the product structure allows predicting its functionality.,contradiction

At pressures above 5 GPa the coupled substitution of Si and Mg (and Fe) onto the Y site occurs in garnets within mantle assemblages as a result of the breakdown of both orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene.,contradiction

"While the value of the bulk and shear moduli, Ks and G, reported by these studies cover a relatively small range, the exact dependence particularly of Ks on Mj content is unclear, large discrepancies in elastic moduli pressure derivatives exist, the thermal properties are poorly constrained as is the effect of the Alm content.",contradiction
"Consequently, the interpretations of seismic velocity gradients in the transition zone remain uncertain.",contradiction

"The values of the EoS parameters (Table 3 ), KT0, KT0?,G0, G0? and ?S0 were obtained through a least square minimization of the differences between observed and calculated aggregate wave velocities.",contradiction
"In the refinement the ambient volume V0 was fixed to the value obtained from X-ray diffraction, the Gru?neisen parameter ?0 and the logarithmic volume derivative of the effective Debye temperature, q0, were kept at values previously determined for garnets (Xu et al., 2008).",contradiction

The acoustic velocities of the Py76Mj24 and Py78Alm6Mj16 samples measured at ambient conditions in different crystallographic directions as a function of ? angle are shown in Fig. 1 .,contradiction
Typical Brillouin spectra are also reported in the insets in the same Figure.,contradiction
"The elastic anisotropy of the two majoritic-garnets is practically negligible both at ambient conditions and at high pressures and temperatures, as also observed for other garnets (e.g. Sinogeikin and Bass, 2000; Murakami et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2013).",contradiction

Elastic constants can thus be obtained by fitting the solutions of the equation of motion to the measured sound velocities.,contradiction
"However, as reported in previous studies (Murakami et al., 2008), the elastic constants of majoritic garnet can also be calculated by averaging the measured acoustic velocities over several non-symmetric directions given the negligible anisotropy.",contradiction

"Brillouin spectra collected on samples within diamond anvil cells at different pressures, temperatures and orientations typically have different signal to noise ratios that depend on the crystal optical quality and its orientation in addition to the laser focusing, sample alignment and collection time.",contradiction
The resolution of such spectra will influence the uncertainties on the Vs and Vp values used to obtain the elastic constants.,contradiction
"The uncertainties on the velocities of the garnet crystals were assessed using a set of Brillouin spectra collected for the same sample but with different signal to noise ratios, varied by adjusting the length of data collection time between one hour to several days.",contradiction
A ?calibration curve? was then constructed that describes the standard deviation on the velocity measurements as a function of the signal to noise ratio.,contradiction
"Uncertainties of 20 m/s, i.e. 0.2?0.4% can be obtained when the best alignment is achieved, but usually they are larger than this value (see text S2 supplementary information).",contradiction

"For each experimental point, the absolute pressure (Table 2) was determined according to the equation(7)P=?V0VKT(V)VdV where the unit-cell volume (V) was determined by means of X-ray diffraction, and the isothermal bulk modulus KT was derived from the adiabatic bulk modulus KS calculated using Brillouin sound velocities, according to the following expression:(8)Ks=KT(1+??T) where ? is the volume thermal expansion and ? is the Gru?neisen parameter.",contradiction
The values of ? and ? for majoritic garnets were assumed to be equal to those of pyrope and were taken from Ahrens (1995).,contradiction
The variation of the shear (VS) and compressional (VP) wave velocities as a function of absolute pressure obtained in this study at high pressures and temperatures are reported in Fig. 2 .,contradiction
"The values of VS and VP wave velocities of Py76Mj24 and Py78Alm6Mj16 are very similar at room pressure, however, they deviate at high pressures, with Py76Mj24 displaying faster velocities due to the higher pressure derivative of the elastic moduli.",contradiction
"The elastic properties of garnets determined in this study were used along with additional literature data (summarized in Table 4) to calculate seismic velocities for pyrolite, harzburgite and MORB bulk compositions at the base of the transition zone, in the depth range between 480 and 660 km.",contradiction
Calculations were not performed at lower pressures due to the absence of sufficient data on the clinopyroxene mineral properties.,contradiction
The calculations were performed along an adiabat with a potential temperature of 1673 K employing thermodynamic models to describe variations in the proportion and chemistry of the mineral phases.,contradiction
A Voigt?Reuss?Hill averaging scheme was used to extract the aggregate elastic properties from those of the individual minerals.,contradiction
"Phase relations at the base of the transition zone are relatively simple and can be described using models that have been derived within a number of experimental studies (Frost, 2003; Frost and Dole??s, 2007; Saikia et al., 2008).",contradiction
"At 480 km a pyrolite composition will be comprised of only wadsleyite and majoritic garnet (Irifune and Isshiki, 1998).",contradiction
"Based on the bulk composition and using Fe?Mg partitioning data from Irifune and Isshiki (1998) it is then straight forward to calculate the compositions of both phases, which results in 42 vol.% garnet with the composition Py14Alm8Mj56Gr21.",contradiction
"At approximately 540 km, wadsleyite undergoes a phase transition to ringwoodite over a depth interval of approximately 20 km, which can be described using thermodynamic models that have been fit to experimental data (Frost, 2003; Frost and Dole??s, 2007).",contradiction
Between 480 and 620 km the garnet composition and proportion remain constant apart from small changes in Fe?Mg partitioning between wadsleyite and ringwoodite.,contradiction
"However, at 620 km CaSiO3 perovskite (Ca-Pv) starts to exsolve from garnet, with the volume proportion of Ca-Pv gradually increasing with depth at the expense of the grossular component of garnet (Saikia et al., 2008).",contradiction
"As a consequence, the garnet composition loses Ca but also becomes less majoritic.",contradiction
The gradual increase of Ca-Pv and the consequent compositional variations in garnet can be described using the thermodynamic model of Saikia et al. (2008).,contradiction
"At the base of the transition zone the pyrolite mineralogy comprises 58 vol.% ringwoodite, (Mg0.9Fe0.1)2SiO4, 36 vol.% garnet (Py34Alm9Mj51Gr4) and 6 vol% CaSiO3 perovskite.",contradiction
"In contrast to pyrolite, an average MORB composition in the mantle transition zone is composed almost entirely of garnet (89 vol.%) with additional stishovite (11 vol.%) (Irifune et al., 1986).",contradiction
"As for the pyrolite composition, in the lower transition zone Ca-Pv starts to exsolve from majoritic garnet, the phase relations of which can also be described using the thermodynamic model of Saikia et al. (2008).",contradiction
"Because the Ca content of subducted oceanic crust (MORB) is higher than that of pyrolite, garnets should become saturated in CaSiO3 at lower pressures.",contradiction
"However, the saturation pressure is also a function of the garnet majorite component (Saikia et al., 2008), which is lower in MORB with respect to a pyrolite composition.",contradiction
These two effects act in opposite directions and ensure that the exsolution of CaSiO3 perovskite from garnet occurs at approximately the same depth as observed for the pyrolite composition.,contradiction
"With increasing pressure, as CaSiO3 perovskite exsolves, the garnet becomes more Al-rich.",contradiction
"At the base of the transition zone the MORB mineralogy comprises 72 vol.% garnet (Py58Alm20Mj3Gr19), 11 vol, % SiO2 and 17 vol.% CaSiO3 perovskite.",contradiction
"Harzburgite phase relations are similar to those of pyrolite over the same depth interval, with the main difference being a higher proportion of (Fe,Mg)2SiO4.",contradiction
"At 480 km the average harzburgite composition employed (Irifune and Ringwood, 1987b) is calculated to comprise 81.5 vol.% wadsleyite and 18.5 vol.% of majoritic garnet with the composition Alm12Mj80Gr8.",contradiction
"Phase transformations are similar to those in pyrolite, although due to the low Ca content the exsolution of CaSiO3 is almost insignificant and the low Al content results in a more majorite rich garnet.",contradiction
The sound velocities VS and VP calculated for the three bulk compositions described above are compared with the seismic reference models PREM and AK135 in Fig. 6 .,contradiction
"Although the pyrolite model is in agreement at least with AK135 in terms of VP, there is a consistent negative deviation for VS, by ?0.2 km/s, between pyrolite and both reference models over the 150 km of the base of the transition zone.",contradiction
Garnet elastic properties are the main reason for this deviation as both ringwoodite and CaSiO3-perovskite have velocities that are above both reference models at these conditions.,contradiction
"Reference models are globally averaged velocity structures and it should, in principal, be possible to approximate this structure using an average mantle composition, mineralogy and temperature.",contradiction
"Reference models are unlikely to capture the detail of the velocity structure, however, particularly in the transition zone, due to the overly simplified polynomial functions upon which they are based (Cammarano et al., 2005).",contradiction
"Trade-offs between the magnitude of seismic discontinuities and the velocity gradient, for example, are likely to cause inaccuracies in the determinations of both.",contradiction
"On average, however, negative deviations from the real mantle velocity structure would be expected to be balanced by near-by positive deviations.",contradiction
"This would appear not to be the case in the transition zone, however, if a pyrolite model along a 1600 K adiabat is assumed to resemble the real mantle.",contradiction
"Irifune et al. (2008) also reported that estimated velocities for pyrolite are lower than the reference models at approximately 575 km, but suggested that the subsequent exsolution of CaSiO3 perovskite from garnet would decrease the discrepancy towards the base of the transition zone.",contradiction
Sinogeikin and Bass (2002) similarly argued that CaSiO3 perovskite exsolution would raise the velocity gradient.,contradiction
"Note, however, that in this study, the gradual formation of CaSiO3-rich perovskite and the resulting compositional variations in garnet have been taken into account.",contradiction
A very slight increase in the velocity gradient for the pyrolite model occurs above 570 km due to CaSiO3 exsolution.,contradiction
Without this exsolution the pyrolite velocities would have the same gradient as the harzburgite model.,contradiction
"Although shear wave properties of CaSiO3 perovskite are poorly constrained, the G0 used in the current model (Xu et al., 2008) is at the very high limit of recent theoretical studies (Kawai and Tsuchiya, 2015) and is higher than experimental estimates (Kudo et al., 2012).",contradiction
"Therefore, it seems unlikely that the Vs for CaSiO3 perovskite is significantly underestimated, in fact the contrary seems more likely.",contradiction
"It appears, therefore, that pyrolite along a 1673 K adiabat provides a poor match to seismic reference models at the base of the transition zone.",contradiction
"Other bulk compositions have been proposed for the transition zone, such as piclogite (Bass and Anderson, 1984; Anderson and Bass, 1986), however from Fig. 6 it appears that increasing the basaltic component of a mineralogical assemblage does not result in an increase of VS values to levels compatible with the reference models.",contradiction
"For the MORB composition, the exsolution of CaSiO3 perovskite can be clearly seen to cause an increase in gradient above 550 km.",contradiction
"Although the resulting gradient is closer to the reference models, the absolute values remain 0.1 km/s below both reference models throughout the base of the transition zone.",contradiction
"A number of other effects that could, in principal, cause differences between mineral and seismic models are also likely to further lower the calculated mineral velocities.",contradiction
"For example, anelastic effects that cause dispersion and variations of mineral velocities as a function of acoustic wavelength are likely to lower the velocities of mineral models that account for them.",contradiction
"Similarly, the presence of minor defects such as those caused by the presence of dissolved OH? in minerals also will only lower velocities (Jacobsen, 2006).",contradiction
If subducted material accumulates at the base of the transition zone it is possible that a significant portion of the material in this regions is composed of melt depleted harzbugite.,contradiction
"As shown in Fig. 6, although melt depletion increases the proportion of (Fe, Mg)2SiO4 phase which raises velocities, they still fall below the reference models.",contradiction
One of the few remaining plausible explanations for the deviation between mineral and seismic models at the base of the transition zone would be if the average mantle temperature over this depth interval is below the 1673 K adiabat.,contradiction
"While mantle adiabatic temperatures determined from erupted basalt melt compositions vary by approximately ñ150ø, (Lee et al., 2009), the estimated temperature needed for the pyrolite model to match the seismic model at the base of the transition zone is ?500 K lower than 1673 K.",contradiction
"This would place mantle temperatures far outside of the range of adiabatic temperature estimates from the surface or from temperature estimates based on the depth of the 410 km discontinuity (Frost, 2008).",contradiction
Saikia et al. (2008) noted that to associate the 520 km seismic discontinuity with the wadsleyite to ringwoodite transformation requires lower than expected average mantle temperatures.,contradiction
"This can be seen in Fig. 6, where the wadsleyite to ringwoodite transformation along a 1673 K adiabat occurs at 550 km, and only if temperatures were ?300 K lower would the transition occur at 520 km.",contradiction
Saikia et al. (2008) suggested that a possible cause of lower mantle temperatures may be the presence of subducting slabs stagnating at the base of the transition zone and flattening out to form significant lateral cold heterogeneities.,contradiction
"Some tomographic models (e.g. Ka?rason and Van der Hilst, 2000) appear to clearly indicate that such heterogeneities exist.",contradiction
"As temperatures in the center of such slabs could be easily 600 K below the average mantle, they could drag down average mantle temperatures at these depths, assuming that the lateral anomalies were large enough.",contradiction
Furthermore it is possible that a significant proportion of this material will be of near harzburgite composition.,contradiction
It can be estimated that temperatures would have to be only 200 K below the 1673 K adiabat for harzburgite mineral model velocities to match seismic reference models at the base of the transition zone.,contradiction
"If such global horizontal anomalies exist, this average reduction in temperature may be plausible and would be also consistent with the 520 km seismic discontinuity being caused by the wadsleyite to ringwoodite transformation.",contradiction
A further issue that needs to be investigated is the effect of the mineral akimotoite which is expected to form in both harzburgite and pyrolite compositions if temperatures at the base of the transition zone were several hundred degrees lower than the 1673 K adiabat.,contradiction
"The elastic properties of akimotoite are poorly explored, however in a recent experimental study the presence of akimotoite has been proposed to raise seismic velocities at the base of the transition zone (Zhou et al., 2014).",contradiction
"Fig. 3 shows determinations of the adiabatic bulk (KS0) and shear (G0) moduli for garnets along the Py?Mj join made in this and previous studies, plotted as a function of Mj content.",contradiction
The Py78Alm6Mj16 sample is also plotted in addition to two other Alm and Alm and Gr bearing samples from Murakami et al. (2008) and Irifune et al. (2008) respectively.,contradiction
There seems to be a very good agreement between the several studies suggesting that G0 decreases slightly with Mj content.,contradiction
"Furthermore, Py78Alm6Mj16 lies on the same trend, in excellent agreement with studies on the end-member Alm (Jiang et al., 2004), which has an almost identical G0 to Py.",contradiction
"The sample studied by Murakami et al. (2008) with 10% Alm plots slightly below the Py?Mj trend, on the other hand, although the difference is relatively small.",contradiction
"The Alm and Gr bearing sample of Irifune et al. (2008) plots well above the trend, this is also consistent with measurements on the pure Gr end-member (Jiang et al., 2004), which shows a significantly greater G0 (109 GPa) compared to Py.",contradiction
A little more scatter exists in the Py?Mj trend for KS0 with a number of relatively high estimates being made by ultrasonic studies at Mj contents ?40?50%.,contradiction
"Many of the Brillouin scattering studies are in good agreement, however.",contradiction
"That KS0 for Py78Alm6Mj16 is higher than Py76Mj24 is in qualitative agreement with measurements made on pure Alm, which are higher than the Py end member (Jiang et al., 2004).",contradiction
In Fig. 4 the moduli pressure derivatives KS0? and G0? are plotted as a function of Mj content.,contradiction
There is very little variation in G0? even for Alm and Gr bearing samples but KS0? covers a significant range with many ultrasonic measurements indicating relatively high values.,contradiction
As it can be seen in Fig. 2(a) there are clearly resolvable differences in the pressure derivatives between the Py76Mj24 and Py78Alm6Mj16 samples.,contradiction
The combination of absolute pressure determinations and the use of a Ne pressure medium should ensure that these derivatives are of the highest precision measured for garnet samples to date.,contradiction
The lower values of KS0? determined for the Alm bearing sample is consistent with the studies of Murakami et al. (2008) and Irifune et al. (2008).,contradiction
Using the equation of state parameters obtained for Py76Mj24 and Py76Alm8Mj16 (Table 3) sound velocities for these two compositions have been calculated at 20 GPa as a function of temperature up to 2000 K (Fig. 5 ).,contradiction
These are compared with the trend determined for a polycrystalline Py23Alm6Mj50Gr21 sample by Irifune et al. (2008) up to 1673 K and ?18 GPa.,contradiction
"Irifune et al. (2008) reported that the observed behavior was very different from that normally obtained by extrapolating linear dependences of elastic moduli with temperature, as commonly performed in literature studies (see for example Lu et al., 2013).",contradiction
"Note, however, that the thermo-elastic model for the for Py76Mj24 and Py76Alm8Mj16 samples reproduces the non-linear temperature behavior of the velocities.",contradiction
Garnet compositions are likely to vary within the upper mantle and transition zone as a result of pressure and temperature dependent changes in chemical partitioning between coexisting minerals in addition to variations in the mantle's bulk composition.,contradiction
"In order to model the effects of these changes in chemistry on seismic velocities, elastic properties for complex garnet compositions need to be calculated from those of the major end-members, i.e. Py, Mj, Alm and Gr.",contradiction
"The elastic properties of a phase consisting of a solid solution of n end-members in a single mineral phase can be derived through a weighted summation of the individual elastic properties of the corresponding end-members:(15)?ss=1?i=1n1miVi?i=1nmiVi?i where ?ss is the bulk elastic property of interest, ?i is the elastic property of component i and Vi and mi are the volume and mole fraction of component i.",contradiction
This summation assumes that the property in question varies as a linear function of the end-member properties.,contradiction
"Recent determinations of KT0? for solid solutions along the Gr?Py binary suggest that this may not always be an accurate assumption (Du et al., 2015).",contradiction
"Due to potential non-linear effects it is possible that fictive end-member properties, determined using data on garnets that have intermediate compositions (and that may, therefore, be closer to those in the mantle), may reproduce the experimental velocities better than using data obtained for end-member compositions.",contradiction
"Using the equation of state model described in Section 3.3, velocities for the Py76Mj24 and Py78Alm6Mj16 samples were calculated through a summation of the elastic properties of the appropriate end-members, as in equation (15).",contradiction
"The initial values of V0, KT0?,?0,?0,q0, G0, G0?, and ?S0 for the Py, Mj and Alm end-members were initially taken from Xu et al. (2008) (Table 4 ), although Debye temperatures for Py and Mj were recalculated in accordance with equation (14).",contradiction
"The resulting velocities were then compared with the high pressure and temperature experimental values, and the properties for Py, Mj and Alm were refined to minimize the calculated and observed differences.",contradiction
Values which differ from those reported in the compilation of Xu et al. (2008) are reported in bold in Table 4.,contradiction
The lines in Figs. 3 and 4 show how the moduli and their derivatives change across the Py?Mj join according to the resulting model.,contradiction
"Using data for Gr from the literature (Xu et al., 2008), the model has been used to calculate acoustic velocities for the Py23Alm6Mj50Gr21 composition examined by Irifune et al. (2008).",contradiction
"The model calculations, performed at 20 GPa as a function of temperature, are compared with the experimental curves of Irifune et al. (2008) in Fig. 5.",contradiction
"The shear velocity curve reported by Irifune et al. (2008) is extremely well reproduced by the resulting model, both in terms of the absolute values and the velocity gradient with temperature.",contradiction
The calculated longitudinal velocities are higher by ?1 km s?1 than the experimental values at room temperature but converge to be in excellent agreement at mantle temperatures.,contradiction
"Although the agreement should be in principal good at all temperatures, it is possible that in the multianvil measurements deviatoric stresses at low temperatures cause this difference, which decreases with temperature (Gwamnesia et al., 2006).",contradiction
"Zirconium alloys are mainly used in the nuclear industry for cladding and structural parts as pressure tubes, channels and guide tubes materials due to their low thermal neutron absorption cross-section, high corrosion resistance and moderate mechanical performance during the reactor service [1].",contradiction

It is seen that the Cp values from SGTE for Sn and Zr increase more quickly with increasing temperature than the present predictions.,contradiction

"Here we provide a detailed discussion on high-pressure properties of Mg, Fe and Mn, based on which to speculate that of Sr.",contradiction
"In carbonophosphates structure the metal 2 + cation occupy the same sites with the same coordination environment, which thus seems to be little responsible for the different behaviors.",contradiction
"Besides, the spin state is another factor influencing the properties of transition metals.",contradiction
Both Fe2+ and Mn2+ maintain their high-spin state in the present studied pressure range.,contradiction
So we believe that ionic radius is the direct consideration in discussion of their differences.,contradiction
"On pressuring above ?12 GPa, Mg, Fe and Mn undergo considerable contraction without any phase transitions.",contradiction
"There exist slight differences in the structural compressibility, which is reflected in the EoS parameters.",contradiction
An inverse linear correlation between the bulk modulus and the radius of metal cation (M2+) is well plotted in Fig. 6 .,contradiction
It can be understood easily.,contradiction
The smaller Mg2+ (0.72 A? [47]) and shorter MgO bonds in Mg leads to a more compact packing of the crystal structure.,contradiction
It is also manifested through the smaller cell volume of Mg (302.9(1) A?3) relative to that of Fe (303.3(3) A?3) and Mn (313.4(2) A?3).,contradiction
"The stronger mutual repulsion between atoms in Mg is resistant to external compression, which exhibits a slightly higher K 0 value.",contradiction
"Abiding by the negative correlation (Fig. 6), we propose a lower K 0 value of Sr to be ?32 GPa subjected to the Sr2+ radius (1.18 A? [47]).",contradiction
The pressure coefficients along crystallographic axes exhibit an elastic anisotropy of ? c > ? b > ? a for carbonophosphate members (Table 2).,contradiction
That means the c-axis is more compressible than the a- and the b-axes.,contradiction
It could be expected from the layered framework parallel to the ab-plane which contains rigid [CO3] groups.,contradiction
Thus the bulk compression is more contributed by the contraction of the c-axis rather than the ab-plane.,contradiction
"An interesting phenomenon should be noted: the a- and the b-axes become compressible gradually and slowly from Mg to Fe and to Mn, but the c-axis undergoes a sharply soften in Fe and Mn.",contradiction
It may show connections to the [MO6]-octahedron distortion and the anisotropic lattice expansion caused by the substitution of larger Fe2+/Mn2+ for Mg2+ sites.,contradiction
The slight incompressibility of Mg is largely rooted in the relative stiffness of the c-axis.,contradiction
Sr is proposed to have the most compressible c-axis in carbonophosphates.,contradiction
Raman spectroscopy is a strong and useful tool to probe into the local variations of [PO4] and [CO3] groups.,contradiction
We obtained the shift rate of symmetrical stretching mode is 2.91(7) for [PO4] and 3.24(8) cm?1 GPa?1 for [CO3] in Mn.,contradiction
"According to Gao et al. [38], the shift rate of Mg is 3.56(6) for [PO4] and 3.69(3) cm?1 GPa?1 for [CO3] (Table 2).",contradiction
That means the [PO4] and [CO3] units in Mg are more sensitive to pressure than those in Mn.,contradiction
"The symmetrical stretching vibration is structurally related to compressibility of PO bond, so the shift rate indicates that the PO bond in Mn bears less pressure effect than that in Mg.",contradiction
"The lower ? value of [PO4] and [CO3] groups in Mn (?0.16) also implies pressure-unresponsive behaviors than those in Mg (0.24 for [PO4] and 0.22 for [CO3], [38]).",contradiction
"The sluggish reaction in Mn is mainly due to the fact that the larger [MnO6] bears more contraction, causing the partial pressure on anion groups to be reduced.",contradiction
"Raman spectrum of Fe and Sr is unavailable, yet it is reasonable to deduce that the reaction of anion groups in Fe is close to that in Mn, and in Sr is more sensitive to pressure effect.",contradiction
Carbonates on the Earth generally adopt trigonal or orthorhombic symmetry whereas carbonophosphates is structurally in monoclinic system with a double-layered framework.,contradiction
The [PO4] tetrahedron play an architectural role linked with [MO6] octahedron to form the characteristic layers.,contradiction
"In contrast to the [CO3] triangles are framesets in carbonates sharing three O atoms with the neighbor [MO6] (M = Mg, Fe, Mn, etc.) octahedron, the [CO3] in carbonophosphates act as bridges linking different polyhedral sheets or, can be considered as ?separators? to depolymerize the [MO6]-[PO4] aggregations [38].",contradiction
The loose structure is responsible for the considerable contraction of carbonophosphates; the presence of periodically arranged channels should be a weak resistance directly to the external pressure when the crystal volume is under reduction.,contradiction
"It is manifested obviously by the bulk modulus values: magnesite MgCO3, siderite FeCO3 and rhodochrosite MnCO3 are all with larger isothermal EoS parameters (MgCO3: K 0 = 137(3) GPa K 0? = 4(fixed) [14]; FeCO3: K 0 = 110 (2) GPa K 0? = 4.6(2) [20]; MnCO3: K 0 = 126(10) GPa K 0? = 4(fixed) [18]) than carbonophosphate members (Mg: K 0 = 60(1) GPa, K 0? = 3.9(7) [38]; Fe: K 0 = 56(1) GPa, K 0 ?? = 3.3(1); Mn: K 0 = 54(1) GPa, K 0? = 3.4(1)).",entailment
"An exception is calcite-CaCO3 with BM EoS parameters of K 0 = 67(2) GPa and K 0? = 4(fixed) [15], close to that of carbonophosphates.",contradiction
Calcite has rich phase modifications during compression process.,contradiction
"It transforms to aragonite at ?2 GPa [16], during which undergoes a sequence of metastable polymorphs along the ?300 K compression path [13,24].",contradiction
The difference in structural stability between carbonophosphates and calcite is rooted in different compression mechanisms.,contradiction
"In carbonophosphates framework, there exist vacant channel plus large [NaOn] (n = 6,7) polyhedron yielding major volume contraction, thus the [CO3] triangles bears little pressure effect because they share only one O atom with [NaO6] polyhedron [38]; whereas in calcite structure, the volume contraction is mostly realized by strong compression of [CaO6] octahedron, which would induce more coordination number of Ca2+.",contradiction
And the [CO3] triangles tend to rotate or/and distort as they are frameset with three corner-linked to [CaO6] polyhedron.,contradiction
"In spite of the above differences, carbonates and carbonophosphates exhibit clearly compression similarities.",contradiction
"First, the coplanar arrangement of the [CO3] triangles in both families results to a more compressible c-axis with a relatively rigid ab-plane.",contradiction
"Besides, a negative relationship between the bulk modulus and the ionic radius of M2+ is determined for carbonophosphates here, as is for calcite-type carbonates by Zhang and Reeder [15].",contradiction
"Besides, an intensive discussion on pressure-dependence variations of [CO3] triangles in carbonophosphates and the analogues has been reported by Gao et al. [38]; the [CO3] display similar rigidness in carbonophosphates to carbonates.",contradiction

The description of weakly bonded materials within the DFT framework is notoriously a complicated task.,contradiction
"Even though in recent years several efforts were made to improve and validate the description of the vdW interaction within DFT [34,35], the accurate calculation of properties, such as elastic constants, remains challenging.",contradiction

Fig. 2 shows an XPS survey of the grown single crystal.,contradiction
"Besides the core levels of Sn and Se, the XPS spectrum exhibits O-1s and C-1s peaks coming from contamination of oxygen and carbon in the bulk single crystal of SnSe.",contradiction
"When inspecting the XPS spectrum of SnSe, it should be taken into account that, due to the inevitable presence of Se vacancies, the surface of SnSe crystal undergoes to rapid oxidation and, thus, signal from O core levels is enhanced in XPS, which is a technique with surface sensitivity.",contradiction

Theoretical predictions have been tested by nanoindentation experiments.,contradiction
Fig. 3 a reports the results of a first dataset of CSM nanoindentation with a maximum load of 10 mN.,contradiction
The absence of pop-in events in the indentation curve (Fig. 4 a) indicates that the material was not damaged during indentation.,contradiction
"The intrinsic values of Young's modulus and hardness which have to be considered are those reached after the fully plastic contact, when experimental values are stable.",contradiction
"However, whereas the Er value stabilizes at 25 GPa at the maximum penetration depth reached during the indentation, the H value does not stabilize, and an evaluation of the material hardness cannot be pursued.",contradiction
A second set of CSM nanoindentations was then performed with a higher load in order to obtain stable values of both Young's modulus and hardness.,contradiction
"Results in Fig. 3b indicate that for a penetration depth up to ?400 nm, H stabilizes at a value of 0.8 GPa.",entailment
"Correspondingly, Er is stabilized around the same value observed with a lower indentation load, i.e. ?25 GPa.",contradiction
"For values of penetration depth higher than 400 nm, H starts to decrease.",contradiction
An abrupt drop is observed for a penetration depth higher than 1000 nm.,contradiction
"This phenomenon is caused by the damage of the material during the indentation process, as testified by the pop-in events observed in the load-penetration depth curve of Fig. 4b.",contradiction
"Actually, a small decrease of both hardness and Young's modulus occurs in correspondence of a penetration depth of 200 nm.",contradiction
"However, we can exclude the possibility of sample damage can occur, since both H and Er values increase again after this drop.",contradiction
"Load-penetration curves corresponding to experimental dataset in panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 3 are displayed in Fig. 4, panels (a) and (b), respectively.",contradiction
"The latter curve, measured for a maximum load of 100 mN, shows numerous pop-in phenomena, i.e. abrupt displacement modifications at a definite load value.",contradiction
"The pop-in observed in Fig. 4b at a penetration depth of 200 nm is really small, if compared with the larger pop-in events observed for higher penetration depths.",contradiction
"Therefore, the measured values of 0.8 GPa and 25 GPa for H and Er, respectively, can be considered reliable.",contradiction
"Such values were also verified by additional CSM indentation tests performed at different loads, that led to the evaluation of the following average values and standard deviations: 25.3 ñ 0.4 GPa for the reduced Young's modulus Er, and 0.82 ñ 0.03 GPa for the hardness H.",contradiction
"As an example, Fig. 5 shows the results obtained with a maximum indentation load of 30 mN.",contradiction
"Again, the Young's modulus stabilizes at a value of 25 GPa.",contradiction
"However, as for the indentation performed with a maximum load of 10 mN, the hardness value does not stabilize and continues to increase.",contradiction
"Therefore, the indentation load of 30 mN is not enough to establish a fully plastic contact enabling the evaluation of a load-independent value for the hardness (as that shown in Fig. 3b), contrarily to the case of the indentation load at 100 mN.",contradiction
The hardness of SnSe was previously determined to be 0.27 ñ 0.05 GPa by Tyagi et al. [59].,contradiction
"However, we note that this value was obtained by Vickers indentation at a very high load, i.e. 0.98 N [59], that is about ten times higher than the maximum load used in the dataset corresponding to Figs. 3b and 4b.",contradiction
"We have demonstrated that the damage of SnSe occurs already for indentation loads higher than 10 mN, as evidenced by the presence of pop-in events in Fig. 4b.",contradiction
"Moreover, Tyagi et al. [59] have employed polycrystalline samples, while our samples are single crystals.",contradiction
"Therefore, we believe that the estimation of the hardness provided in the present work can be considered reliable.",contradiction
"Concerning indentation modulus, it is evident from the comparison of experimental results in Fig. 3 and theoretical predictions in Table 2 that the agreement is missing for the eleven different exchange-correlation energy functionals used in our DFT calculations.",contradiction
"The deviation of the indentation modulus estimated by theory with respect to the experimental value is minimal for PBE-D2 and PBE-TS functionals, with an overestimation by about 25%.",contradiction
"However, the presence of defects in the real samples inevitably implies an overestimation of the Young's modulus by theory.",contradiction
"Moreover, the comparative theoretical analysis in Table 2 suggests that LDA is completely inadequate for evaluating the Young's modulus of SnSe.",contradiction
"This could be explained by the existence of weak interlayer bonds in SnSe, which emphasize the usual over-binding problem of LDA approximation, resulting into shorter bond lengths and greater binding energies.",contradiction
"It should be evidenced that our PBE estimation of the Young's modulus is much nearer to the experimental value compared to previous DFT results by PBE, reported by Li et al. [32], which instead overestimate the Young's modulus by even 66%.",contradiction
"On the other hand, our direct measurement of the Young's modulus is in agreement with the value obtained by an indirect estimation on the basis of the measurement of the longitudinal and shear acoustic velocities [60], i.e. 27.7 GPa.",contradiction
"It is worth mentioning that the unavoidable oxygen and carbon contamination in bulk single crystals of SnSe could be, in principle, one of the reasons of the deviation between experiments and theory, together with the remarkable amount of surface oxidation evidenced by XPS (Fig. 2).",contradiction
"Finally, we report the bulk modulus, the shear modulus and the Poisson's ratio calculated employing different eleven exchange-correlation functionals.",contradiction
The bulk modulus ranges between 25.63 GPa (PBE) up to 43.36 GPa (LDA).,entailment

The shear modulus in our calculations has values between 17.54 GPa (PBE) and 28.13 (LDA) GPa.,contradiction
"For the sake of comparison, it is worth mentioning previous works predicted just smaller values: 14.7 [61] and 17.1 [32] GPa.",contradiction
"The Poisson's ratio ranges in most cases between 0.22 and 0.23, with only vdW-DF-rvv10 giving 0.26.",contradiction
"Previous works reported similar values, i.e. 0.21 [32] and 0.25 [61].",contradiction
We have investigated by means of depth-sensing nanoindentation the mechanical properties of bulk single crystals of SnSe grown by chemical vapor transport.,contradiction
"We estimated Young's modulus and hardness to be 25.3 ñ 0.4 GPa and 0.82 ñ 0.03 GPa, respectively.",contradiction
"Experimental results are not satisfactorily reproduced by DFT calculations, even if PBE-D2 and PBE-TS functionals appear to be the most suitable for the case of SnSe.",contradiction
"The inspection of load-penetration depth curves also highlights the manifestation of large pop-in events, originated from material damage, for load values greater than 60 mN (corresponding to a penetration depth of 800 nm).",contradiction
"XPS analysis indicates a remarkable oxidation at the surface of the SnSe single crystal, likely driven by the presence of Se vacancies, as well as contamination by oxygen and carbon in the bulk.",contradiction
Both aspects should be considered to explain the deviation of experimental findings with respect to theoretical predictions.,contradiction
"Present work Ä combining state-of-the-art single-crystal growth, nanoindentation, and DFT calculations Ä significantly improves the comprehension of mechanical properties of SnSe, thus paving the way toward its effective exploitation in nanotechnology (nanomechanics and flexible electronics).",contradiction

"Low stacking fault energy of the ? phase has been proved to impede the dislocation cross-slip and improve the creep resistances of the superalloys [8,9].",contradiction
This can be achieved by introducing different alloying elements into the fcc Ni matrix [10?12].,contradiction
"However, many studies have revealed that the deformation modes of fcc metals cannot be determined by stacking fault energy alone [13?15].",contradiction
"Instead, generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) or the so called ?-surface can provide more comprehensive information on the operation of plastic deformation mechanisms [16,17].",contradiction
The ?-surface or the GSFE represents the excess energy associated with slipping half of the fcc crystal within a close-packed (1 1 1) plane along the lowest energy path corresponding to the ?1 1 2? direction.,contradiction
"The three fundamental parameters describing the ?-surface are the intrinsic stacking fault (ISF) energy, the unstable stacking fault (USF) energy and the unstable twin fault (UTF) energy.",contradiction
"The ISF is formed when one close-packed atomic layer is missing from the ideal fcc (1 1 1) packing, which corresponds to a two-layer hexagonal close-packed (hcp) embryo embedded in the fcc lattice.",contradiction
The USF and UTF energies describe the lowest energy barriers for the nucleation of leading and twinning partial dislocations respectively.,contradiction
"The propensity of twinning (i.e. twinnability) of fcc metal can be characterized by various models based on the above parameters [16,18,19].",contradiction
"Studying the ISF, USF, UTF energies and the corresponding twinning models is expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of the plastic behavior Ni-based alloys, which is in turn closely related to the creep deformation mechanisms specifically at intermediate temperature [5].",contradiction
"Due to the difficulties associated with measuring the ISF energy at high temperature [20] and the lack of methodologies obtaining the unstable energies merely from experiments, first-principles calculations have become the primary tools to obtain GSFE and thus analyze the plastic deformation behaviors of metals and alloys [21?23].",contradiction

"Moreover, the published results on the temperature-dependent planar fault energy of pure Ni via phonon calculations are also inconsistent [27?29].",contradiction
"Because Mo is the main solid-solution strengthening element in ? phase [1], our previous study on Ni-Mo solid solution focused on the effect of Mo at static conditions and revealed that increasing Mo concentration changes the shape of the GSFE curve and enhances the twinnability as a result [30].",contradiction

"In the framework of the EMTO, the coherent potential approximation (CPA) [37,43] was adopted to treat the compositional disorder of Mo in Ni-based solid solution and the full charge-density technique [35,36] was used to calculate the total energy.",contradiction

At this point we should mention that a better description of the high-temperature paramagnetic phase would be the disordered local magnetic (DLM) model [50].,contradiction

"As for the plastic deformation mechanism closely related to the emission of the trailing partial dislocation following the leading one, several measures have been proposed to evaluate the twinning tendencies of metals based on plastic mechanics.",contradiction
"In the present study, two twinnability measures are used to evaluate the twinning tendency of Ni-Mo solid solution at high temperature, which have been proved to be applicable in this system [30] with the expressions as follows [16,18]:(3)T=3?usf-2?isf/?utf (4)?d=?isf/?usf-?isf The twinnability measure T is derived within the Peierls framework involving the ISF, USF and UTF energies, while ?d is an improved measure simply depending on the first half of ?-surface.",contradiction
Twinning mechanism is considered to be favored with T > 1 or small positive value of ?d.,contradiction
"Based on the GSFE results of Ni-Mo solid solutions at high temperature, the temperature and composition effects on their twinnability are studied.",contradiction
"As shown in Fig. 9 (a), the twinnability of Ni-5at.%Mo is enhanced obviously with increasing temperature which has much higher T value larger than 1 and small positive ?d value.",contradiction
"In other words, twinning is favored over dislocation slip more at high temperature.",contradiction
"However, the twinnability changes caused by temperature decrease with increasing Mo concentration at 1000 K, especially when the Mo content is higher than 10at.% (Fig. 9(b)).",contradiction
"Consequently, the slopes of the twinnability measures become weaker than those at 0 K.",contradiction
"Among the three contributions to the GSFE changes considered here, the thermal electronic excitation makes the largest effect on the twinnability of Ni-Mo solid solution while the thermal expansion and the magnetic transition both have very limit effects on it.",contradiction
The stronger effect of thermal electronic excitation on the ISF energy compared with those on the USF and UTF energies of Ni-Mo solid solution is considered to be the main reason behind.,contradiction
The enhanced twinnability of the Ni-based solid solution with Mo content below 10at.% suggests the suppressed dislocation slip during its plastic deformation and the necessity of controlling the addition of Mo in order to maintain the strength of Ni-based SC superalloys at high temperature.,contradiction
"Based on the equilibrium Wigner-Seitz radii of Ni-Mo solid solutions obtained in our previous EMTO calculations [30], the elastic parameters including equilibrium bulk moduli, elastic constants and shear moduli at 0 K were calculated first and compared with the VASP results obtained using 16-atom supercell models.",contradiction

The slopes of B 0 and C' against Mo concentration calculated by EMTO are almost the same with those using VASP.,contradiction
"Compared with the experimental results, the EMTO underestimates C' of pure Ni while overestimates B 0 of pure Ni and Ni-Mo with lower Mo content.",contradiction

"Further results in shear moduli, bulk/shear modulus ratio (B 0/G 0) and elastic anisotropy constants (Supplementary data Table S1) indicate that higher Mo concentration enhances the anisotropy and ductility of the Ni-based solid solution with larger values of B 0/G 0 ratio and A G, in addition to its positive effect on the bulk modulus.",contradiction

"The rapid loss of magnetic order in Ni due to Mo alloying has been observed and its Curie temperature is also considered to decrease obviously with increasing Mo content [54,55].",contradiction

At this point we should mention that thermal longitudinal spin fluctuations could give rise to a finite magnetic moment within the present temperature interval [56?58].,contradiction

"The calculated thermal expansion with a linear coefficient of about 12.6 ž 10?6úK?1 agrees well with the experimental value (14.1 ž 10?6úK?1) [59], while its equilibrium bulk modulus decreases by 12.5?18.7% with increasing temperature from 1000 K to 1400 K (Fig. 3 ).",contradiction

"The Wigner-Seitz radius of the solid solution has a positive slope as a function of Mo content at 1000 K, following almost the same trend as that at 0 K (Fig. 4 (a)).",contradiction
"As a result, lower thermal expansion coefficients (?l= (aT-a0)/(a0úT)) are obtained for the solid solutions with higher Mo content because of their larger lattice constants at 0 K (a 0).",contradiction
These results are consistent with the previous ones obtained by molecular dynamics simulation [59].,contradiction
The smaller thermal expansion coefficient but larger atomic size of Mo than that of Ni are partly the reasons behind the obtained trends [59].,contradiction
"On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the reduction in the bulk modulus of solid solution at 1000 K decreases slightly with increasing Mo concentration (Fig. 4(b)), which suggests the stronger strengthening effect of higher Mo content in ? matrix at service temperature.",contradiction
"Compared with the experimental results [53,59], the EMTO results slightly overestimate the slope of lattice constant and underestimate that of bulk modulus against Mo concentration.",contradiction
The increased deviation between the theoretical and experimental data at high Mo concentration might be due to the chemical inhomogeneities (e.g. segregations or other alloying elements) in the experimental samples which are ignored in the present solid solution scheme.,contradiction
"Using the equilibrium volumes at finite temperatures, the GSFEs of Ni-Mo solid solutions were calculated and compared with those at 0 K.",contradiction
"Our previous study on the GSFE of Ni-Mo solid solution at 0 K has obtained consistent results with the VASP ones, which has proved the feasibility of the EMTO method in the planar fault energy calculation [30].",contradiction
At this point we should emphasize an important aspect of the finite temperature GSFE calculations.,contradiction
The USF or UTF energy is an energy barrier meaning that no free energy can be defined for these structures.,contradiction
The only way to describe the full temperature dependence of these barriers is to carry out molecular dynamics simulation based on interaction potentials.,contradiction
Here we follow another route and calculate the energy barriers from energies only accounting for thermal expansion and electronic excitation.,contradiction
"In order to make our approach consistent, the USF, UTF and ISF energies were calculated using the same approximation method above.",contradiction
"Nevertheless, the lattice vibration contribution to the ISF energy at finite temperature will be estimated and discussed later separately.",contradiction
The GSFE changes caused by the magnetic transition from FM to NM as the temperature rising from 0 K to above 1000 K are analyzed as well.,contradiction
The ISF energy of NM Ni at 1000 K was calculated to be 118 mJ/m2.,contradiction
"Compared with the FM value at 0 K (150 mJ/m2), the slope against temperature is basically consistent with the experimental result d? isf/dT = ?0.04 mJ/(m2úK) [60].",contradiction
"It is important to mention that the thermal electronic excitation has an obvious effect on the ISF energy of Ni, which lowers the NM value of 135 mJ/m2 considering only the thermal expansion we get further to 118 mJ/m2.",contradiction
"As for Ni-Mo solid solutions, the ISF energies of Ni-5.at% Mo were calculated from 1000 K to 1400 K both in FM and NM states.",contradiction
The results in Fig. 5 show that the ISF energy of Ni-5.at% Mo decreases with increasing temperature.,contradiction
"Different from the obvious contributions from the thermal expansion and thermal electronic excitation, the magnetic transition from FM to NM only contributes a little to the ISF energy drop.",contradiction
"At 1000 K, the ISF energies of Ni-Mo solid solutions are studied as a function of Mo content so as to reveal the composition effect at high temperature (Fig. 6 ).",contradiction
"Similar to the case at 0 K, the ISF energy of Ni-Mo solid solution at 1000 K decreases with increasing Mo concentration but with a weaker descending slope.",contradiction
"In other words, Mo addition reduces the temperature effect for the ISF energy and Ni-15at.%Mo has almost the same ISF energy at 1000 K with that at 0 K.",contradiction
The thermal expansion and the thermal electronic excitation also give limited contributions to the ISF energy reductions of the high-Mo solid solutions.,contradiction
The unstable planar fault energies including the USF and UTF energies are obtained as the local maxima of ?-surface.,contradiction
"Here we approximate these energy barriers with energies calculated at b = 0.5b0 and b = 1.5b0 respectively, because the true local maxima are usually located very close to the middle point connecting the two consecutive minima.",contradiction
"Similar to the case of ISF energy, the unstable planar fault energies of Ni-Mo solid solution both decrease with increasing temperature obviously (Figs. 7 and 8 ).",contradiction
"However, high temperature (1000 K) has a small effect on the variation of the USF energy with composition (Fig. 8(a)), while the slope of the UTF energy against Mo concentration is less negative than that at 0 K in a small extent (Fig. 8(b)).",contradiction
"Unlike the case of the ISF energy, the higher Mo content has no weakening effect on the reductions of the unstable planar fault energies due to thermal expansion.",contradiction
"Moreover, distinctly stronger effects of magnetic transition than those of thermal electronic excitation are observed on the USF and UTF energies.",contradiction
"This phenomenon is particular true for the solid solutions with 5at.%Mo, in which the magnetic transition has almost constant effects on the USF and UTF energies with increasing temperature (Fig. 7).",contradiction
"It is noteworthy that the consideration of thermal electronic excitation elevates the unstable planar fault energies (Fig. 8) rather than decline them as it does on the ISF energy (Fig. 5), except for the UTF energies of Ni-5at.%Mo (Fig. 7(b)).",contradiction
"Here, the ESF energies of Ni-Mo solid solutions at high temperature are not discussed individually, due to their almost equal values to those of the ISF energies [30].",contradiction
"The slope of the ISF energy in pure Ni at elevated temperature (d? isf/dT) obtained in this work (?0.032 mJ/(m2úK)) is close to but still less negative than the experimental result (?0.04 mJ/(m2úK)), with the considerations of thermal expansion and thermal electronic excitation.",contradiction
"Consequently, the lattice vibration of the perfect and faulted Ni might also contribute to the ISF energy drop at high temperature.",contradiction
The lattice vibration effect on the ISF energy of pure Ni has been studied in previous works via phonon calculations but no consistent result is obtained [27?29].,contradiction
"According to the results in a more recent study, the ISF energy of pure Ni was considered to decrease from 122 mJ/m2 at 0 K to 112 mJ/m2 at 1000 K caused by phonon effect [27].",contradiction
"Due to the larger supercell, denser k-mesh and the similar lattice constant to that in our EMTO calculation they used, this reasonable reduction of ISF energy can be used to correct the ISF energy at high temperature in the present work (detailed method can be found in Supplementary).",contradiction
"Employing the axial nearest neighbor Ising (ANNI) model [63] and the Debye model [34], the higher Debye temperatures (?D) of fcc Ni and Ni-Mo than those with hcp structures (Supplementary data Table S4) verify the further drops of their ISF energies at high temperature due to lattice vibration (Supplementary data Table S5).",contradiction
"However, the reductions in the ISF energies of Ni-Mo solid solutions at 1000 K diminish with increasing Mo concentration.",contradiction
"Unfortunately, it is impracticable to evaluate the lattice vibration contributions to USF and UTF energies via phonon calculation due to their unstable lattices, thus the lattice vibration effects on the twinnability of Ni-Mo at finite temperature are still to be solved.",contradiction
"The GSFE results of Ni-Mo solid solutions at high temperature suggest that the magnetic transition from FM to PM (NM) contributes to the ?-surface changes, particularly for the unstable planar fault energies.",contradiction
"In order to uncover the mechanisms behind, the magnetic moments of Ni components at the fault plane are analyzed and compared with those in the perfect fcc solid solutions.",contradiction
"Using the equilibrium volumes of Ni-Mo solid solutions at 1000 K, the magnetic moments of Ni components are found to drop sharply with increasing Mo concentration both in the perfect fcc and faulted lattices (Supplementary data Fig. S1).",contradiction
"This result is in good agreement with the dramatic drops of magnetic moment and Curie temperature in Ni by Mo alloying [58,59], which also proves the reasonability of treating the Ni-Mo solid solution as NM state at the temperatures far above T c.",contradiction
"Furthermore, larger changes in the magnetic moment of Ni caused by the introduction of planar faults are observed when varying the Mo content from 5at.% to 10at.%.",contradiction
"Nevertheless, the magnetic effects on GSFE are rather weak in the high-Mo solid solution, owing to their much smaller (even zero) absolute values of magnetic moments.",contradiction
The higher deviations of magnetic moments provided by USF and UTF than that by ISF in Ni-5at.%Mo are considered to be the main reasons of the stronger magnetic effects on its unstable planar fault energies.,contradiction
The particularly important role of thermal electronic excitation in metals is due to their non-zero electronic density at Fermi level.,contradiction
"Hence, the total density of states (DOS) of the perfect and faulted Ni-Mo solid solutions are compared, in order to explain the different contributions of thermal electronic excitation to the ISF, USF and UTF energies against composition.",contradiction
"As shown in Supplementary data Table S3, the total DOSs around Fermi level in the faulted lattices with ISF are higher than those in the perfect fcc lattices, which suggests the more negative electronic excitation energies (F ele) in the faulted lattices.",contradiction
"As a result, further reductions of ISF energies at high temperature are found in these solid solutions.",contradiction
"Nevertheless, the DOS difference between faulted and perfect lattices decreases with increasing Mo concentration, along with the evident drops of the DOSs themselves.",contradiction
These results can explain the weak effects of electronic excitation on the ISF energies of high-Mo solid solutions.,contradiction
"Contrary results appear in the most cases of USF and UTF, in which the DOSs around Fermi level are lower in the faulted lattices instead.",contradiction
These are consistent with the elevated unstable planar fault energies at high temperature due to the thermal electronic excitation.,contradiction
The particular case of the UTF energy in Ni-5at.%Mo can be ascribed to its much larger DOS with UTF than that in the perfect lattice.,contradiction
"Moreover, the discrepancies in DOSs between the perfect and faulted lattices with USF or UTF are smaller than those with ISF, corresponding to the stronger effect of thermal electronic excitation on the ISF energy.",contradiction
First-principles alloy theory as implemented in the EMTO-CPA method and quasiharmonic approximation was employed to predict the thermo-mechanical properties of Ni-Mo solid solution.,contradiction
"The temperature effects as well as the composition effects of Mo on the equilibrium lattice constants, equilibrium bulk modulus and GSFE at finite temperature are discussed in detail.",contradiction
"Besides the enhanced modulus, anisotropy and ductility with Mo alloying at 0 K, the bulk moduli of the Ni-based solid solutions decrease strongly with increasing temperature.",contradiction
"However, higher Mo concentration causes a lower thermal expansion coefficient and a reduced temperature effect for the bulk modulus of the solid solution, which still results in a positive slope of bulk modulus against Mo concentration at high temperature.",contradiction
"On the other hand, the ISF, USF and UTF energies of Ni-Mo solid solutions all decrease with increasing temperature.",contradiction
"Less negative slopes of ISF and UTF energies against Mo concentration are observed at 1000 K, while the variation trend of USF energy with composition is similar to that at 0 K.",contradiction
"As a consequence, the twinnability of the Ni-based solid solution at high temperature is only enhanced for lower Mo content.",contradiction
"The thermal expansion, the thermal electronic excitation and the magnetic transition from FM to PM (NM) all contribute to the GSFE changes at elevated temperature.",contradiction
The different effects of these composition-dependent contributions on the changes of the stable and unstable planar fault energies are considered to be the main mechanisms.,contradiction
"The lattice vibration at finite temperature may also affect the twinnability of Ni-Mo solid solution at high temperature, which still needs to be solved via the molecular dynamics simulations of unstable planar fault configurations.",contradiction
The composition-dependent GSFEs of Ni-Mo obtained here offer a possibility of fine-tuning the elasticity and twinnability of ? matrix and improving the creep resistances of Ni-based SC superalloys especially at intermediate temperature.,contradiction
"A Portland cement is a complex multi-component system and, to predict its elastic properties, an exhaustive database of the thermodynamic parameters of the main constituents is needed.",contradiction
"The synthetic counterpart of the mineral ettringite (ideally Ca6Al2(SO4)3(OH)12únH2O, with n = 24?27), also known as calcium aluminate trisulphate hydrate, is one of the most important crystalline phases in Portland cements.",contradiction
"In nature, ettringite is a rare mineral that occurs in metamorphosed limestone or as a low-temperature secondary-alteration phase, usually associated with portlandite, gypsum or afwillite.",contradiction
"Ettringite-like phase plays different roles in Portland cements: i) in early hydration stages, its crystallization governs the set rate of the highly reactive Ca3Al2O6 (?C3A?); ii) in aged cements, delayed formation of ettringite can promote degradation processes, in particular when limestone is used as a filler and a diffusion of sulphate-rich fluids occurs (e.g., by contact with groundwater or sulphate-bearing soils) [1?4].",contradiction
"The crystal structure of ettringite is significantly complex (Fig. 1 ): its principal building units consist of [Ca3[Al(OH)6]ú12H2O]-columns, running parallel to [001], in which Al(OH)6-octahedra alternate with triplets of Ca(OH)4(OH2)4-polyhedra, disposed around the 3-fold axis; these units are connected by sulphate groups via hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules.",contradiction
"A very recent paper by Gatta et al. [5] reported the structural model of ettringite based on single-crystal neutron diffraction data, with a full description of the complex H-bonding scheme of the structure.",contradiction
"Clark et al. [6] investigated, by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy, the high-pressure behavior of ettringite from ambient pressure up to 6.4 GPa.",contradiction
"The authors found a transformation into an amorphous phase at ~3 GPa and estimated (by fitting only two P-V point) the isothermal bulk modulus (K 0 = ?V(?P / ?V) = 1 / ?0, where ?0 is the volume compressibility coefficient at room conditions) of ettringite to 27(7) GPa, with the linear bulk moduli along the a and c crystallographic directions (i.e., 23(10) GPa and 36(12) GPa, respectively).",entailment
"This K 0 value is similar to what obtained by Scholtzova? et al. [7] and Speziale et al. [8] which, via Brillouin spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, determined the bulk modulus of ettringite to be in the range of 27?30 GPa.",entailment
"Using DFT, also Manzano et al. [9], simulated the crystal structure and electric properties of ettringite up to 5 GPa.",contradiction
The bulk modulus obtained from the fit of the calculated volumes between 0 and 2.5 GPa was found to be 29 GPa.,entailment
"Above about 2.5 GPa, the simulation evidences a sharp decrease in the bulk compressibility (by about 40%), which was explained by a ?densification? of the hydrogen bond network.",contradiction

"Despite the previous studies at high pressure provided a general view of the compressional behavior of ettringite, a description of the deformation mechanisms at the atomic scale is still missing, as the quality of the X-ray powder diffraction data at high pressure, coupled with the structural complexity of ettringite, hindered the structure refinements.",contradiction
"Furthermore, the K 0 value obtained by Clark et al. [6] is merely qualitative as it is the result of the fit through only two P-V points.",contradiction
"On the other hand, Cuesta et al. [10] compressed the ettringite powder in silicone oil, considering a hydrostatic limit of 3 GPa according to Klotz et al. [11].",contradiction
"However, Angel et al. [12] described silicone oil as hydrostatic only up 0.8 GPa, and the poor data fit of Cuesta et al. [10], with one single function between 0 and 3 GPa, could be the result of using silicone oil out of its effective hydrostatic limit.",contradiction
"In this light, we have investigated the compressional behavior of ettringite up to 4.2 GPa by means of in-situ single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction, using a diamond-anvil cell (DAC) and the mix methanol:ethanol (4:1) P-transmitting fluid, which allow a description of the structure deformation mechanisms at the atomic scale and the determination of the bulk elastic parameters of ettringite, based on hydrostatic conditions within the P-range investigated [11,12].",contradiction

Indexing of the diffraction peaks and integration of their intensities (corrected for Lorentz-polarization effects) was performed using the CrysAlis package [15].,contradiction
Corrections for absorption (caused by the DAC components) were applied using the semi-empirical ABSPACK routine implemented in CrysAlis [15].,contradiction

"The positions of the inter-column ?free? H2O sites were obtained by a careful analysis of the difference-Fourier maps of the electron density, based on the structure refinements performed with the crystal in air.",contradiction
"The analysis of the difference-Fourier maps of the electron density function revealed a cigar-like shape of the Ca atom occupying the Ca2 site, so this site was refined with an anisotropic displacement parameter.",contradiction
"In order to reduce the number of the refined variables, the displacement parameters (D.P.) of all the sites (excluding Ca2) were refined as isotropic.",contradiction
"Moreover, the D.P. of the H2O-oxygen occupying the O19 and O20 sites were fixed to U iso = 0.03 A?2 and those occupying the sites O13, O15, O16, O17 and O18 were fixed to U iso = 0.08 A?2, leading to the best figures of merit.",contradiction
"As common for high-pressure experiments based on X-ray diffraction, no H-sites were located and refined.",contradiction
"It is worth to underline that, differently from the structural model of Gatta et al. [5], in this study the maximum of the electron density function corresponding to O20 is positioned on the three-fold axis.",contradiction
"This is probably a mere artifact of the structure refinement, induced by the low number of reflections available with the crystal in the DAC (due to the limited portion of the reciprocal space actually accessible).",contradiction
The refined unit-cell parameters at high pressure are listed in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 2 .,contradiction

"Relevant inter-atomic distances are reported in Tables 2, 3 and S3.",contradiction
The evolution of the bond-distances with P shows that the SO4 tetrahedra are almost uncompressible within the P-range investigated.,contradiction
"The Al-octahedra are more compressible, as the Al-O distances are compressed by 0.01?0.04 A? within the P-range investigated (Table 2).",contradiction

H2O molecules generated by the three-fold axis) and the O19?O15 and O19?O13 ones (which represent, respectively, the distances between the H2O molecule and the oxygen atoms of the S1- and S3-tetrahedra) are only slightly affected in response to the applied pressure.",contradiction
"The most prominent changes in the ettringite structure at high pressure affect the O?O distances involving the oxygen atoms of the SO4-tetrahedra and those of the Ca(OH)4(OH2)4-polyhedra (Table 3, Fig. 3 ).",contradiction
"These inter-atomic distances lie on the ab-plane and decrease pronouncedly in response to the applied pressure (e.g., O9?O16 and O5?O15 decrease by almost 0.2 A?), which is consistent with the fact that the linear bulk modulus along the c direction is almost twice that along the a (or b) direction.",contradiction
"It is worth to remember that O5, O6, O8, O9, and O19 are all oxygen sites of H2O molecules and that, unfortunately, it is impossible to localize the corresponding H atoms in high-pressure experiments.",contradiction
"Nevertheless, based on the hydrogen atoms configuration recently reported by Gatta et al. [5], on the basis of a single-crystal neutron structure refinement, it is possible to draw some considerations.",contradiction
"For instance, O15 site is at ~1.82 A? from H16, H7 and H1.",contradiction
O6 is the oxygen site of the H2O molecule having H1 and H6 as proton sites.,contradiction

"O18 is at ~1.80 A? from H3, H2 and H6, and O5 is the H2O oxygen site having H3 and H7 as proton sites, whereas O6 has H6 and H1 as proton sites.",contradiction
"This means that, overall, the interaction O15?O6, O16?O9, O18?O5 and O18?O6 are mediated by H-bonds.",contradiction
"As pressure increases, the distances between the oxygen sites drastically decrease (Table 3, Fig. 3).",contradiction
"This is consistent with the findings of Clark et al. [6], which indicated that the amorphization process takes place at ~3 GPa.",contradiction
"As no other inter-atomic distances evolve in a significant way, the only realistic explanation to the collapse of the structure it is connected to the increasing interaction between the oxygen atoms of the Ca-polyhedra and those of the SO4 tetrahedra, as well as to the likely collapse of the H-bonding system.",contradiction
"Considering that the crystal structure of ettringite consists of [Ca3[Al(OH)6]ú12H2O]-columns parallel to [001], and connected by sulphate groups via hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules, a significant change in the H-bonding scheme could lead to critical derangements.",contradiction
"As the hydrogen bond strength follows the same exponential trend that dipole-dipole interactions follow, it decays with r 3 (where r is the distance between the two dipoles).",contradiction
"In this light, a decrease of 0.20 A? of the Odonor?Oacceptor distance (i.e., as revealed by the structure refinements) is pronounced and may lead to a dramatic change of the bonding configuration, ultimately resulting in weakening of the structure itself, which is consistent with the elastic softening observed by the P-V plot (Fig. 2, Table 4).",contradiction
"Based on their DFT simulations, Manzano et al. [9] calculated the K P0 of ettringite and predicted the densification of the hydrogen bonds scheme, which is indirectly corroborated by the structure refinements of our study.",contradiction
"The authors, however, indicated a decrease of the bulk compressibility in response to such a densification.",contradiction
"Nevertheless, the interactions between the hydrogen bonds network and the oxygen sites of the SO4-tetrahedra ultimately enhance the bulk compressibility, giving rise to the opposite elastic behavior, as experimentally observed.",contradiction
It is highly likely that the complex network of weak inter-atomic interactions in the ettringite structure is the cause of the discrepancy between DFT modelling and experimental behavior.,contradiction
The evolution of the unit-cell volume of ettringite with pressure (data listed in Table 1) is shown in Fig. 2.,contradiction
"The compressional pattern appears to be monotonic up to 3 GPa, where a change of the compressional behavior occurs.",contradiction
"Above 3 GPa, a marked increase of the volume compressibility takes place, mainly due to a softening on the ab plane (see Fig. 2).",contradiction
"It is worth to note that such a softening is coupled with a sharp decrease of the number of observed reflections, which ultimately hindered any structure refinements above 2.3 GPa (see next section).",contradiction
Data collected in decompression at 1.16 and 0.25 GPa (blue triangles in Fig. 2) are perfectly in trend with the data collected during compression.,contradiction
This proves an ideal elastic behavior of ettringite within the P-range investigated.,contradiction
"To describe the (isothermal) compressional behavior of ettringite, the unit-cell volume vs. pressure data were fitted, using the EoS Fit 7.0 software, to an isothermal Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (BM-EoS), truncated to the second order in energy [17,18].",contradiction

"At P > 3 GPa, a pronounced softening of the structure, mainly governed by a sharp increase of the (001) compressibility, occurs; such a softening is accompanied and followed by a severe decrease of the number of observed reflections, which hinders any structure refinement above 2.2 GPa.",contradiction

"The structure of armstrongite (Fig. 1 ) consists of sheets made by [Si6O15]6- building units, which are generated by the condensation of xonolite-like chains running along the b axis (Fig. 1) [6].",contradiction
"The resulting [Si6O15]6- -sheets are characterized by four- and eight-member rings of tetrahedra alternating along [100] and by four- and six-member rings alternating along [010] (hereafter 4-, 6- and 8- mRs, respectively) (Fig. 2 ).",contradiction
"ZrO6 octahedra are connected with the SiO4 tetrahedra to give the (ZrSi6O15)2? heterogeneous framework, in which CaO5(H2O)2-sevenfold coordination polyhedra are edge-connected to ZrO6 octahedra to form columns running parallel to [010] (Fig. 1).",contradiction

"This study is aimed to extend the knowledge about the behavior of armstrongite under extreme conditions, with the description of its high-pressure behavior under hydrostatic compression.",contradiction
"To date, no X-ray diffraction data at high pressure are available in the open literature and, consequently, the compressional parameters of this material are still unknown.",contradiction
"In addition, in the last years, the crystal-fluid interaction promoted by pressure in zeolite-like compounds is being object of a raising interest, especially in the fields of materials science and mineralogy.",contradiction
"Although armstrongite is a heterosilicate, its structure, with a framework density (FD) ?21.86 (lying in the range of zeolites), could be a potential candidate for molecular intrusion enhanced by increasing pressure.",contradiction
"On this basis, we have investigated the high-pressure behavior of armstrongite up to 8 GPa by means of in-situ single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction, using a diamond-anvil cell (DAC) and a potentially penetrating P-transmitting fluid.",contradiction
"A single crystal of armstrongite (same specimen described by Mesto et al. [5] and in Lacalamita et al. [8]) from Khan Bogdo, Mongolia, with a prismatic habit (?50 ž 20 ž 20 ?m in size) was selected on the basis of its optical quality for the high-pressure experiment, performed at the ID15B beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France.",contradiction
A parallel monochromatic beam operating with an E = 30.16 KeV (? ? 0.411 A?) was used.,contradiction
"The crystal was loaded in a membrane-driven DAC, with 600 ?m Boehler-Almax design anvils, along with some ruby spheres for pressure determination (pressure uncertainty ñ0.05 GPa [9]).",contradiction
"A stainless steel foil (with thickness ? 250 ?m) was pre-indented to 70 ?m and then drilled by spark-erosion, leading to a P-chamber of ?200 ?m in diameter.",contradiction
"Before adding the methanol:ethanol:H2O = 16:3:1 mix, used as hydrostatic P-transmitting fluid [10], a first data collection was performed with the crystal in the DAC without any P-fluid.",contradiction
"The adopted data collection strategy consisted in a pure ?-scan (?32ø? ? ? +32ø), with 1ø step width and 1s exposure time per step.",contradiction

Further details pertaining to the beamline experimental setup are reported in Merlini and Hanfland [11].,contradiction
Indexing of the diffraction peaks and integration of their intensities (corrected for Lorentz-polarization effects) was done using the CrysAlis package [12].,contradiction
Corrections for absorption (caused by the DAC components) and background were applied using the semi-empirical ABSPACK routine implemented in CrysAlis [12].,contradiction
The structure refinements of the armstrongite structure at room and high pressure were performed using the software JANA2006 [13].,contradiction
"Starting with the structure model of Mesto et al. [5], a series of structure refinements were performed up to 4 GPa, at which the material experiences a P-induced phase transition with a triplication of the unit-cell volume.",contradiction
"In the structure refinements of the low-P polymorph, in order to reduce the number of the refined variables, the atomic displacement parameters (D.P.) were modelled as isotropic.",contradiction
"For the high-P polymorph, unfortunately, the low (reflections/parameters to be refined) ratio hindered the structure solution of the crystal structure.",contradiction
The unit-cell parameters with P are listed in Table 1 and the principal statistical parameters of the structure refinements are listed in Tab.,contradiction

"S3 (SM), whereas other relevant distances are reported in Table 2 .",contradiction
The Zr-O distances of the low-P polymorph (reported in Tab.,contradiction
"S3, SM) do not change drastically with P.",contradiction
Though the intra-tetrahedral Si-O distances (reported in Tab.,contradiction
"S3, SM) do not show drastic changes up to 3.27 (5) GPa, it is worth noting that a considerable distortion of the Si(1)-O4 and Si(2)-O4 tetrahedra is observed in the structural model refined at 4.01 (5) GPa.",contradiction
This distortion is mainly governed by the sharp decrease of the Si(1)-O (2) distance coupled with an increase of the Si(2)-O (2) distance (Tab.,contradiction
"S3, SM).",contradiction
"Nevertheless, similarly to zeolites (e.g Refs. [17?19]) and others open-framework materials ([20] and references therein), the bulk compression is mainly accommodated through the tilting of the TO4 units around the shared oxygen hinges.",contradiction
"In armstrongite, the effects of such a behavior affect especially the diameters of the 6-mRs and 8-mRs (reported in Table 2 and shown in Fig. 3).",contradiction
"For the 6-mRs, for example, the extension of the O7-O7 diameter with P is coupled with the compression of the O8-O8 one, leading to a noticeable distortion of this building unit (Fig. 4 ).",contradiction
"Likewise, the distortion of the 8-mRs at high pressure is mainly due to the increase of the O6-O6 diameter, coupled with the decrease of O7-O7 and O1-O1 (Fig. 4).",contradiction
"With increasing pressure, the rotation of the ZrO6 octahedra is reflected by the change of the O1-O7-O2, O8-O1-O9, O1-O9-O3 and O2-O4-O3 angles (Table 4 ).",contradiction
"The O1-O9-O3 and O2-O4-O3 angles, for example, increase respectively by about 10.6 and 10.3% (?P ? 4 GPa).",contradiction
The distortion of the 5-mRs is mainly governed by the decrease of the O1-O7-O2 and O8-O1-O9 angles (Fig. 4).,contradiction
"Further (O-O-O) angles, related to the 5-mRs, are given in Tab.",contradiction
S4 (SM).,contradiction
"Fig. 2 shows a 5-mR (formed by four SiO4 tetrahedra and one ZrO6 octahedra) at ambient pressure and at 4.01 (5) GPa, respectively.",contradiction
"The role played by the CaO5(H2O)2-sevenfold coordination polyhedra, in order to accommodate the effects of pressure, appears to be only secondary (Tab.",contradiction
"S3, SM) and subordinate to the tilting of Si-tetrahedra and Zr-octahedra.",contradiction
The evolution of the unit-cell parameters as a function of pressure is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S1.,contradiction
"Overall, the unit-cell parameters decrease steadily up to 4.01 (5) GPa (Table 1).",contradiction
"In this P-range, the lengths of the b- and c-edges decrease by 3.5 and 3.2%, respectively, whereas along a the edge length decreases by only 1.5%; the unit-cell volume is reduced by about 8.8% (Fig. 3).",contradiction
"Between 4 and 5 GPa, armstrongite undergoes a phase transition characterized by a triplication of the unit-cell volume (Table 1 and Fig. S1, S2 SM), as a result of the triplication of the c unit-cell edge (Table 1).",contradiction
The associated volume discontinuity reflects a first-order phase transition.,contradiction
"Comparing the unit-cell volume of the low-P polymorph at 4.01 (5) GPa and the V/3 of the high-P one at 5.07 (5) GPa, a difference of about 5.2% occurs.",contradiction
"In order to maintain the metrical configuration, the lattice of the high-P polymorph is better described as I-centered, and the reflection conditions suggests the space group I2/m as highly likely.",contradiction
"The metrical relationship between the lattice of the low-P (C2/m) and high-P (I2/m) polymorphs can be ideally expressed as: a? = a, b? = b, c? = 3c.",contradiction
"The phase transition affects also the value of the monoclinic ? angle: as shown in Fig. 3, in the low-P form, ? progressively increases from 109.37 (1)ø at ambient pressure to 110.38 (4)ø at 4.01 (5) GPa; for the high-P polymorph, the ? value appears to be nearly unaffected by P with an average value of 103.1ø (ñ0.2ø) (Fig. 3, S2 SM).",contradiction
"In order to describe the (isothermal) compressional behavior of both low- and high-P polymorph, the experimental V-P data, weighted by their uncertainties, were fitted to a third-order (BM3-EoS) and a second-order (BM2-EoS) Birch-Murnaghan Equations of State [14,15], respectively, using the EoS Fit 7.0 software [16].",contradiction
The refined elastic coefficients of the fit are reported in Table 3 .,contradiction
"The high-P polymorph has a bulk modulus K V0 (i.e., K V0 = ?V 0 (?P/?V)P=0 = 1/?V0, where ?V0 is the volume compressibility coefficient) ? 50% higher than that obtained for the low-P one, indicating a significant increase in stiffness in response to the phase transition.",contradiction
"Moreover, a remarkable change of the ?axial bulk moduli? (calculated simply by substituting the cube of the individual lattice parameter a 3, b 3, c 3 for the volume in the EoS) [15] occurs from the low-to the high-P polymorph: K b and K c increase from 23 to 50 GPa and from 26 to 46 GPa, respectively, whereas K a falls from 78 to 35 GPa.",entailment
"Therefore, the phase transition leads to a pronounced decrease of the compressibility along [010] and [001] coupled with a marked increase along [100].",contradiction
"Data collected in decompression show a significant hysteresis loop, as the high-P phase is stable (at least) down to 2.91 (5) GPa (Fig. 2, Table 1).",contradiction
"In this study, we have investigated, for the first time, the behavior of armstrongite at high pressure, on the basis of in-situ single crystal X-ray diffraction data collected up to 8.01 GPa.",contradiction
"Data collected at high pressure show a first-order phase transition, bracketed between 4.01 (5) and 5.07 (5) GPa.",contradiction
The unit-cell volume of the high-P polymorph triplicates (Table 1).,contradiction
"The bulk compression of the low-P polymorph is mainly accommodated through the tilting of both SiO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra, around the shared oxygen hinges.",contradiction
"In fact, these polyhedra behave as quasi-rigid units; in this respect, armstrongite behaves similarly to other microporous minerals, such as zeolites [e.g 17?19, 21 or heterosilicates, such as its Na-analogue, elpidite (Na2ZrSi6O15ú3H2O) [22].",contradiction
"In elpidite, one of the major distortion mechanisms in response to hydrostatic compression is represented by the opposite rotations of the Zr-octahedra.",contradiction
"Also elpidite experiences a P-induced phase transition, between 1.2 and 1.9 GPa, with doubling of the a cell parameter (and consequently of the unit-cell volume).",contradiction
"Tilting of the Zr-octahedra is the common deformation mechanism between elpidite and armstrongite (either at high temperature and high pressure [8, 22 and this paper]), whereas the role played by Ca (or Na) appears to be only secondary in armstrongite at high pressure but it is critical in elpidite at HP and in armstrongite at HT [8,22].",contradiction
"Unfortunately, the triplication of the unit-cell volume prevented the structure solution of the high-P polymorph of armstrongite, hindering a comparison between the high-pressure structures of armstrongite and elpidite.",contradiction
"However, armstrongite seems to be more stable to pressure with respect to its Na-analogue, which undergoes a (presumably) second-order phase transition between 1.2 and 1.9 GPa [22].",contradiction
The lack of the structure model of the high-P polymorph of armstrongite does not allow any speculation about the character of the first-order phase transition observed between 4.01 (5) and 5.07 (5) GPa: displacive or reconstructive?,contradiction
"Overall, the high-P polymorph of armstrongite is found to be stiffer than the low-P one (i.e., K V0 increases by about 50%, Table 3), and a remarkable change of the elastic anisotropic scheme occurs: K c ? K b ? 13 K a for the low-P form, K c ? K b ? 1.4K a for the high-P form (Table 3).",contradiction
"On the basis of the structure refinements of the low-P polymorph, we can infer that no evidence of crystal-fluid interaction, with a selective sorption of molecules of the P-transmitting fluid through the cavities, occurs.",contradiction
"This kind of effect was observed in several open-framework materials when compressed in fluids made by small molecules (e.g., with kinetic diameter shorter than the free diameters of the structural cavities), recently reviewed by Gatta et al. [20].",contradiction
"It is highly likely that the channel population in armstrongite structure hinders the penetration of the new molecules (e.g., H2O) in response to the applied pressure.",contradiction
A peculiarity of shape-memory alloy single crystals is their orientation-dependent pseudo-elastic behavior [2?5].,contradiction
It is therefore crucial to be able to determine the best possible orientation for a specific application.,contradiction
"Here, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of tensile and compressive loading of three differently-oriented austenitic nickel-titanium (NiTi) shape-memory alloys (SMAs) at 350 K and assess their performance.",contradiction
We also perform bending simulations of NiTi nano-wires in the same orientations to assess the orientation dependence of the bending behavior.,contradiction
"Equi-atomic NiTi SMAs are increasingly being considered for use in actuation and mechanical damping in nano- and micro- devices [4,6,5] due to their pseudo/super-elastic behavior.",contradiction
This feature stems from the ability of the alloy to exist in more than one phase depending on temperature and stress.,contradiction
Austenite is the high-temperature parent phase and has a cubic B2-type crystal structure.,contradiction
"When an external load is applied at a high temperature, above the martensitic start temperature, the B2 phase transforms into the monoclinic B19? martensitic phase, thereby accommodating deformations up to 10%.",contradiction
"Upon removal of the external load, the material transforms back into the B2 phase and regains its initial shape manifesting its pseudo-elastic behavior.",contradiction
"This deformation behavior during a stress-induced martensitic transformation has been experimentally shown to depend on the orientation of the initial B2 crystal in micrometer size single-crystal specimens [7?11] and can be explained with the lattice deformation model (LDM) [12,13].",contradiction
"The final variant of martensite formed upon loading depends on the loading direction with respect to the initial B2 crystal, thereby causing a difference in the deformation behavior.",contradiction
Single-crystal SMA devices at the nano- and micro-scale can benefit from the higher transformation strains along certain orientations of the alloy.,contradiction
"Since the direction-dependent behavior for a single crystal can be easily determined through simulations, atomistic simulation techniques such as molecular dynamics (MD) can be used to optimize the design of SMA devices by predicting the best orientation of the crystal for a given application.",contradiction
"Prior to doing this, it becomes necessary to analyze and validate the SMA pseudo-elastic behavior under tension and compression predicted by MD simulations along various orientations.",contradiction
The nano-structural changes and deformation behavior during pseudo-elasticity along certain orientations in bulk and nano-size specimens have been already shown through atomistic simulations by different groups and using different potentials; a complete picture with the same system and potential is however missing and will be provided in this study.,contradiction
Zhong et al. [14] observed a reversible B2-B19? transformation in 4.8 nm ž 5 nm sized NiTi nano-pillars using the Finnis-Sinclair interatomic potential [15].,contradiction
Their study was restricted to the compressive behavior of a ?110? oriented B2 nano-pillar.,contradiction
Wang et al. [16] also used the Finnis-Sinclair potential to simulate cyclic compressive loading on ?110? oriented nano-pillars and observed changes in the mechanical response with increasing cycles.,contradiction
"More recently, Ko et al. [1] simulated the compressive stress-induced B2-B19? transformation in a nano-pillar with a 10.7 nm ž 10.7 nm cross-section.",contradiction
The pillar was loaded along the ?001?B2 direction at 450 K to validate their newly developed modified embedded atom method (MEAM) interatomic potential.,contradiction
Wang et al. [17] also performed similar simulations under adiabatic condition using the MEAM potential to study super-elasticity under compressive loading along ?001?B2.,contradiction
"In these works, the analysis has been restricted only to compressive loading along one orientation of the initial B2 phase.",contradiction
The MEAM potential has also been used to demonstrate phase transformation in NiTi polycrystals subjected to a single compressive [18] and cyclic compressive [19] loading.,contradiction
"Recently, we have shown [20] that the MEAM potential [1] is more suited than the Finnis-Sinclair [21,14] to study pseudo-elasticity in single-crystal NiTi because of its ability to predict lattice and elastic constants more accurately.",contradiction
"Hence, we use the MEAM potential to provide a comprehensive analysis of the elastic response of bulk NiTi under tensile and compressive loading before, during, and after phase transformation at different temperatures.",contradiction
Three different initial orientations of bulk single-crystal austenite are considered in this contribution (Section 2) where tensile and compressive loading simulations are performed at 350 K.,contradiction
"Results, shown in Section 3, indicate the directions along which the transformation strains are highest.",contradiction
"The transformation strain values and the modulus of the initial and final phases are compared to experimentally known values and those obtained from the lattice deformation model [12,13].",contradiction
The effect of temperature on the transformation behavior is examined by performing the same set of simulations at 400 K and 450 K.,contradiction
"To determine the effect of the orientation dependence on an ideal actuator device, MD simulations of bending of nano-wires are also carried out and discussed in Section 4.",contradiction
MD simulations of the stress-induced martensitic transformation in NiTi are carried out using the MEAM interatomic potential [1].,contradiction
"The MEAM potential, which also takes angular interactions into account, captures the directionality in the metallic bonds more effectively than other potentials, making it the most suitable to predict phase transformation.",contradiction
The formulation of the MEAM potential and the parameters for NiTi can be found in the work of Ko et al. [1] and are not reported here.,contradiction
"The potential predicts the martensitic start (Ms) and the austenitic finish (Af) temperatures as 270 K and 490 K, respectively.",contradiction
MD simulations of bulk NiTi are performed using LAMMPS [22] with the Nose?-Hoover [23] pressure and temperature control; the time integration is carried out using a velocity-Verlet algorithm [24] with a timestep of 0.5 fs.,contradiction
"The initial structure is the ordered B2 phase, and three different loading directions are considered: ?110?,?111? and ?100?.",contradiction
"Three periodic cubic simulation boxes, with faces normal to one of the loading directions are created and filled with atoms.",contradiction
"Initially, an energy minimization run is performed using the conjugate gradient method to obtain the stress-free configuration of B2.",contradiction
"Next, the simulation is run for 200,000 steps at zero stress and 350 K until the system is relaxed.",contradiction
"This temperature is chosen since it is greater than the martensitic start temperature Ms, and B2 can therefore exist as the stable phase.",contradiction
Isothermal uniaxial displacement-controlled tension/compression is applied through a constant strain rate of 106 s?1 along the loading direction.,contradiction
"During loading, the average stresses over other surfaces are maintained at 0 MPa to allow for the simulation box shape and size to change.",contradiction
The deformation behavior is described by plotting the virial stress [25] on the x-plane in the x-direction against the corresponding engineering strain component.,contradiction
"The size of the simulation box is increased in steps, and the above process is repeated for each box size until convergence of the stress-strain plot which is found to occur for a 27ž27ž27 nm3 box.",contradiction
This size is therefore chosen as representative for bulk behavior and used to obtain the results discussed in the next section.,contradiction
A schematic representation of the initial system is shown in Fig. 1 (a).,contradiction
"The mechanical behavior during a B2-B19? phase transformation is characterised by the moduli of the initial B2 phase and the final B19? phase and the corresponding transformation stresses and strains, as shown in Fig. 1(b).",contradiction
"The stress at which the initial austenitic phase deviates from the initial linear elastic slope, denoted by point P in Fig. 1(b), is defined as the transformation stress ?trans.",contradiction
The B2-B19? transformation progresses until the entire crystal is converted to the martensitic phase (point Q in Fig. 1(b)) and continues with its elastic deformation.,contradiction
"When the martensitic elastic loading part of the curve is extended to the horizontal axis (null stress level), the corresponding strain is defined as the transformation strain ?trans at that particular temperature.",contradiction
The difference in stress-strain behavior in the phase transformation region during strain-controlled and stress-controlled loading was discussed in Ref. [20].,contradiction
"Here, we perform strain-controlled loading to study the nano-structural evolution during the B2-B19? transformation.",contradiction
A stress plateau is not expected during the transformation because the transformation is neither instantaneous nor complete at the transformation strain.,contradiction
The uniaxial loading simulations are repeated at 400 K and 450 K where the stress-induced transformation occurs.,contradiction
"For each case, five different realizations with random initial atomic velocities are considered, and the stress and strain values are reported as average values.",contradiction
"Uniaxial tensile and compressive loading simulations are also performed at 400 K and 450 K, temperatures at which NiTi exhibits pseudo-elastic behavior.",contradiction
"Temperature does not affect the transformation mechanism in any of the three tensile or compressive loading directions, but has an effect on the transformation stress, the modulus of the two phases, and the transformation strain.",contradiction
"The effect is the same for all the loading directions, and hence only two cases (one in tension and one in compression) are presented in Fig. 14 .",contradiction
The trend observed here is observed for all other loading directions.,contradiction
Fig. 14 shows the variation of the stress-strain curve with temperature for tensile loading along ?111? and compressive loading along ?100?.,contradiction
"It is known that austenite softens mildly upon cooling, whereas martensite softens upon heating [32].",contradiction
From Fig. 14 it is observed that the MD simulations capture this effect.,contradiction
The influence of temperature on the Young?s modulus of the two phases has an effect also on the stress plateau and the transformation strain.,contradiction
The transformation strain along all orientations decreases as the temperature at which the loading is performed increases.,contradiction
The other noticeable trend is the increase in the transformation stress with increase in temperature.,contradiction
The temperature-dependent transformation stress obtained through MD simulations can be used as an input for the constitutive modeling of shape-memory alloys based on the phase transformation diagram [38].,contradiction
"Here, MD results of tensile and compressive stress-induced transformation along ?110? are shown for the first time using a MEAM interatomic potential.",contradiction
Fig. 2 shows the stress-strain curves obtained by loading the B2 phase at 350 K along ?110? in tension and compression.,contradiction
"In both cases, the initial B2 structure deforms elastically until the transformation stress is reached, at points A? and D? in tension and compression, respectively, after which the B2-B19? transformation begins.",contradiction
The stress-strain behavior is observed to be different in tension and compression in the phase transformation region.,contradiction
"In tension, a non-linear decrease in stress takes place from point A? till point B; this is followed by an increase to point B? after which there is another decrease in stress till point B??, followed by a linear increase in stress.",contradiction
"Upon analyzing the structural changes in the crystal, it is observed that the first decrease in stress after A? occurs due to the transformation from B2 to an orthorhombic B19 intermediate phase.",contradiction
This intermediate B19 phase has also been observed by Zhong et al. [26] and Ko et al. [1] during MD simulations of stress-induced B2-B19? transformation.,contradiction
"Notice that this is a displacement controlled simulation and, while the strain is increased, the overall state of tension in the crystal can revert to compression as a consequence of phase transformation.",contradiction
"The applied strain until transformation is such that the crystal is under tension, but the elongation caused by the transformation would exceed (if unconstrained) the imposed elongation and, therefore, gives rise to a compressive stress state.",contradiction
"The B19 that forms initially after point A is compressively strained in comparison to its relaxed structure, therefore there is a decrease in stress while more and more austenite transform into martensite.",contradiction
"Up to point B, this decrease in stress due to the B2-B19 transformation is more pronounced than the increase in stress due to the loading of untransformed B2, thereby causing an overall non-linear decrease in stress.",contradiction
"After point B, the increase in stress due to the loading of already transformed B19 becomes more pronounced than the decrease in stress due to the B2-B19 transformation.",contradiction
"Upon further straining, the intermediate B19 phase transforms into the monoclinic B19? phase causing another decrease in stress till point B??.",contradiction
"Again, although a tensile loading has led to the transformation of the B2 to the B19? phase, the martensite that is formed at point B?? is still compressively strained compared to its relaxed structure, thereby leading to an overall compressive stress.",contradiction
"After point B?? the martensite deforms elastically, reaches a fully relaxed structure at point C, and continues to deform in the B19? phase.",contradiction
"In contrast, compressive loading involves only one load decrease during the beginning of the transformation (at point D?).",contradiction
"Here, the B2 phase directly transforms into the B19? phase.",contradiction
"Hence, the transformation region is characterized by a combination of decrease in stress due to the B2-B19? transformation and increase in stress due to the elastic deformation of the untransformed B2 and the transformed B19?.",contradiction
"In both cases, at large strain levels and beyond the non-linear region, the B2-B19? transformation is complete (points B?? and E? in tension and compression, respectively) and is followed by the elastic deformation of B19?.",contradiction
This continues until a strain level of 14.5% (11.5%) in tension (compression).,contradiction
"The transformation strain in tension is higher than in compression, whereas the transformation stress in compression is higher.",contradiction
The Young?s modulus of the B2 and B19? phases along the ?110?B2 direction can be obtained from the slopes of the elastic loading branches.,contradiction
Fig. 2(b) shows that the Young?s modulus of the B2 phase is 80.3 GPa and that of the B19? phase formed under tensile (compressive) loading is 132 (218) GPa.,contradiction
"In comparison to the previous work by Zhong et al. [26], the Young?s modulus values of the two phases and the transformation strain obtained here are closer to experimentally known values, as discussed later.",contradiction
"In addition, the asymmetry between tensile and compressive behavior is captured.",contradiction
"Since the orientation of B19? with respect to the initial B2 structure is different under tension and compression, the Young?s modulus is also different.",contradiction
"Fig. 3 shows sectional views of the bulk, cut along the ?11?0?B2 plane, subject to tension and compression, with atoms depicted according to the common neighbor analysis (CNA) pattern.",contradiction
"The CNA pattern differentiates the B2 and the B19? phases, but is not able to differentiate between the intermediate B19 and the B19? phases.",contradiction
Atoms with B2 structure are represented in blue and atoms with B19/B19? structure are represented in red.,contradiction
"Points A, B and C along the tensile curve and points D, E and F along the compressive curve in Fig. 2 are chosen for representation: one along the initial linear elastic loading of B2, one along the B19? elastic loading, and one in between, where the transformation occurs.",contradiction
"From Fig. 3, it is observed that MD simulations predict the B2-B19 transformation in tension and the B2-B19? transformation in compression to progress through the formation of Lu?ders-like bands along the ?112??B2 direction.",contradiction
The width of the bands increases with the strain until the entire bulk is transformed into B19 (B19?) in tension (compression).,contradiction
"Lu?ders-like bands have also been experimentally observed during stress-induced transformation in NiTi [27] and in previous MD simulations of stress-induced transformations in NiTi [21,26].",contradiction
"To differentiate between B19 and B19? phases, three points along the tensile curve (points A?, B? and B??) are chosen and the radial distribution function (RDF) at these points is depicted in Fig. 4 .",contradiction
"The peaks in Fig. 4(a) correspond to the peaks of the B2 phase (at point A?), which has a cubic structure.",contradiction
"B2 (BCC) has fewer neighbor shells in comparison to the B19 or the B19? phase, and hence the RDF has fewer peaks as compared to the other two RDF?s.",contradiction
"By comparing Figs. 4(b) and (c), it is noted that the RDF corresponding to point B?? has additional peaks in between 3 A? and 4 A?.",contradiction
"This arises due to the extra neighbor shells created due to an additional shear in the monoclinic B19? crystal structure (at point B??) in comparison to the orthorhombic B19 crystal structure (at point B?), thereby differentiating the two phases.",contradiction
"The B19? that forms at the end of the tensile and compressive loadings is oriented differently with respect to the initial B2 crystal, as shown in Fig. 5 .",contradiction
Only few Ni atoms are visualized to clearly illustrate the difference in the final B19? variant.,contradiction
The difference in orientation of the monoclinic structure is what leads to the tension-compression asymmetry associated with the transformation.,contradiction
"During loading of B2 along any particular orientation, the final martensite variant is formed in such a way that the transformation strain is highest along that particular orientation.",contradiction
"For instance, in Fig. 5(a), the B19? variant that is formed produces the highest tensile transformation strain along ?110?.",contradiction
"Similarly, the variant in Fig. 5(b) causes the highest compressive transformation strain.",contradiction
"Since the MEAM potential is able to predict the correct variant, and also accurate lattice parameters, it naturally estimates transformation strain values close to experimentally known values along all orientations.",contradiction
This will be discussed later.,contradiction
"The stress decrease at the end of the elastic deformation of B19? in compression, denoted by F? in Fig. 2(b), occurs due to a B19?-BCO transformation.",contradiction
"Although not shown in Fig. 2(a), this is also observed in tension at a strain level of 14.5%.",contradiction
BCO twins with a {0 0 1} twin plane are formed in tension and twins with a {1 1 0} twin plane are formed in compression.,contradiction
"The increase in load makes the B19? phase unstable and leads to its transformation into the BCO phase, thereby releasing the accumulated strain energy.",contradiction
The BCO twins have indeed been theoretically proved to be the most energetically favourable at high strains in ?110?B2 oriented NiTi [28].,contradiction
Further discussion regarding the BCO phase is beyond the scope of this study.,contradiction
Similar MD simulations of compressive stress-induced B2-B19? transformation along ?110? have been performed earlier by Zhong et al. [26] with an EAM-Finnis-Sinclair type interatomic potential.,contradiction
"They observe an intermediate B19 phase until a strain of 5.8%, and the B19-B19? transformation occurs till a strain of 6.6%, after which further loading leads to martensitic plasticity.",contradiction
The B19? phase existing over such a small strain range is unrealistic and the transformation strains are also not predicted accurately.,contradiction
"The MEAM interatomic potential used in this study removes these drawbacks, in addition to predicting pseudo-elastic behavior along other orientations as well.",contradiction
The second orientation chosen for this study is ?111?.,contradiction
MD simulations of the stress-induced transformation of B2-B19? along this orientation have been performed for the first time.,contradiction
The B2-B19? transformation under tension occurs through a different mechanism in comparison to the other loading directions chosen for this study.,contradiction
"Unlike the other cases, this tensile stress-induced transformation occurs through the formation of a multi-variant martensite followed by a martensitic reorientation within the structure leading to a dominant variant at the end of the transformation.",contradiction
"Martensitic reorientation has been noticed earlier in experiments [29], but never observed numerically during a B2-B19? transformation of a single crystal.",contradiction
A more pronounced asymmetry between tensile and compressive behavior as compared to the other cases (see Fig. 6 ).,contradiction
"The modulus of the B2 phase along ?111?B2 is estimated as 125 GPa, and the modulus of the final B19? variant in tension (compression) is 159.2 (242) GPa.",contradiction
"The results also indicate that the transformation strain in tension is much higher than that in compression, and the transformation stress is smaller in tension.",contradiction
The region between points A? and C? corresponding to the tensile stress-induced phase transformation has a large number of fluctuations as compared to the ?110? and ?100? cases which arise due to the reorientation.,contradiction
"In the other cases, a single variant pair of martensite grew through the initial B2 bulk during the transformation.",contradiction
"When a tensile loading is applied along the ?111?B2 orientation, MD predicts a different transformation mechanism of B2 to B19?.",contradiction
The initial elastic deformation of B2 is followed by a decrease in stress that corresponds to the B2-B19? transformation.,contradiction
"At point B, a multi-variant B19? structure is formed.",contradiction
"Upon further straining, martensitic reorientation occurs where one variant of martensite outgrows the other throughout the bulk until a single variant B19? is formed.",contradiction
"During this stage, the stress-strain behavior is characterized by a combination of decrease in stress caused by one variant transforming into another, and stress increase due to the deformation of transformed B19?, thereby leading to a number of kinks in the transformation region.",contradiction
This is followed by the elastic deformation of that favorable B19? single variant.,contradiction
"Since the CNA pattern cannot differentiate between B19? variants, the sectional views of bulk NiTi cut along the ?11?0?B2 in Fig. 7 are depicted according to a per-atom local order parameter (LOP) that was developed by Mutter and Nielaba [30] to differentiate between B2 and B19? phases in NiTi.",contradiction
The color coding for the LOP is also shown in Fig. 7.,contradiction
"Atoms colored in red and blue belong to two different B19? variants, whereas atoms in green are in the B2 structure.",contradiction
Fig. 7 shows that B2 is transformed into a multi-variant B19? at point B.,contradiction
The variant colored in blue grows throughout the entire bulk as the strain increases until it is completely transformed into a single-variant B19? as shown by the image depicting point D.,contradiction
This is not observed under compressive loading along ?111?B2 where the initial B2 transforms into the final B19? variant through a band formation as seen in Fig. 7.,contradiction
"The smaller transformation strain during compression, as compared to that during tension, does not allow for accommodation of multi-variant formation.",contradiction
"Visualizing a few Ni atoms, Fig. 8 shows the different B19? variants formed under tension and compression and the difference across orientations.",contradiction
"Again, these variants are formed in such a way that they produce the maximum transformation strain while loading B2 along ?111?.",contradiction
"Similar to the ?110?B2 case, the decrease in stress after the elastic deformation of B19? occurs due to a B19?-BCO transformation.",contradiction
"Instead of BCO twins that were formed in the ?110?B2 case, here a single variant BCO is formed.",contradiction
The stress-induced martensitic transformation behavior when bulk B2 is loaded along ?100?B2 has been discussed in an earlier work [20] where results along this particular orientation were used to reveal the better performance of the MEAM interatomic potential over the Finnis-Sinclair potential.,contradiction
The results have been reproduced here in order to compare them with the ?110? and ?111? cases.,contradiction
Fig. 9 shows the stress-strain curve under tension and compression at 350 K.,contradiction
"The strain gain obtained during the transformation, negligible under tension, is more significant under compression.",contradiction
"Here, contrary to the previous case with loading direction ?110?B2, the transformation strain is higher under compression, and the transformation stress is higher under tension.",contradiction
The Young?s modulus of the B2 phase is different because the loading occurs along a different direction and the modulus of the B19? phase is also different because a different variant has formed.,contradiction
"Lu?ders-like bands are observed during the martensitic transformation also for this orientation, but along the ?120?B2 plane in tension and in compression (see Fig. 10 ).",contradiction
Fig. 11 shows some selected Ni atoms in the initial B2 and the final B19? variants.,contradiction
Further details regarding the transformation strains and the modulus of both phases can be found in Ref. [20].,contradiction
The dissimilarities seen in the mechanical behavior across these orientations are summarized and validated next.,contradiction
"MD simulations using the MEAM interatomic potential can numerically predict the deformation behavior before, during, and after the stress-induced martensitic phase transformation along three different loading directions of the initial austenitic single crystal.",contradiction
The strain-controlled nature of loading also helps identify the different transformation mechanisms along these loading directions.,contradiction
Fig. 12 directly compares the MD results of the stress-strain behavior under tension and compression along all the directions considered in this study.,contradiction
"An orientation dependence is observed in the transformation stress, the transformation strain, and the elastic modulus of the B2 and the B19? phases.",contradiction
There is tension-compression asymmetry along all directions due to the different final martensite variant that forms under tension and under compression.,contradiction
"To further compare the behavior across the three orientations, the values obtained from MD simulations at 350 K are listed in Tables 1 and 2 for tensile and compressive loading, respectively.",contradiction
"For any application that exploits the pseudo-elastic property of NiTi, the transformation strain is a crucial aspect that needs to be considered.",contradiction
"In this regard, the ?1 1 1? orientation shows the highest transformation strain (8.6%) under tension among the orientations chosen for this study.",contradiction
"Under compression, the ?1 1 0? and ?1 0 0? show higher transformation strain than the ?111? orientation with almost similar values of 4.95% and 5.05%, respectively.",contradiction
The Young?s modulus of the B2 crystal computed from MD results ranges between 25 GPa and 125 GPa depending on the loading direction.,contradiction
"These values are slightly smaller than those obtained experimentally by Brill et al. [31] probably because the simulations are at 350 K, whereas the experiments were performed at 400 K, and B2 is known to soften upon cooling [32].",contradiction
"The austenitic phase B2, being a symmetric crystal, has the same Young?s modulus in tension and compression; the same does not hold for B19?, a monoclinic crystal that can exist in any of its 24 variants.",contradiction
This has led to difficulties in finding accurate experimentally-calculated values for martensite.,contradiction
"Values in the literature range from 80 to 300 GPa [32?34]), which is the range the MD results of B19? modulus lie in.",contradiction
A direct comparison of the MD simulations results to experimental values cannot be made here.,contradiction
"The simulations are performed on single crystals at 350 K, whereas experimental data on mechanical properties during the B2-B19? phase transformation in single crystals are scarce and at different temperatures.",contradiction
"Hence, in the next section, the numerical results of the transformation strain and modulus are compared and validated using values calculated from 0 K ab initio data.",contradiction
Orientation-dependent transformation strains have been calculated in literature for a single NiTi unit cell using the lattice deformation model proposed by Saburi et al. [12].,contradiction
These theoretical values are calculated using 0 K lattice constants of B2 and B19?.,contradiction
"Fig. 13 shows a schematic of the B2-B19? lattice deformation with a0,am,bm,cm and ? as the lattice parameters of the two phases.",contradiction
"Based on the loading direction, a symmetric B2 crystal can transform into any one of the 12 equivalent B19? corresponding variants.",contradiction
The LDM indicates that the variant that produces the maximum transformation strain along that particular direction forms at the end of a transformation.,contradiction
The corresponding transformation strain along that particular direction can be calculated from the lattice constants of the two phases.,contradiction
"The martensitic variants formed at the end of various single-crystal loading experiments have been compared to and validated with those predicted by the LDM [13,7].",contradiction
"There are differences in the transformation strain values since these experiments are not performed at 0 K, whereas the transformation strains using the LDM are calculated from 0 K lattice parameters.",contradiction
"The final B19? variants predicted by the MD simulations in this study (Figs. 5, 11 and 8) are not only identical in structure to those predicted by the LDM, but they are also oriented along the same directions.",contradiction
"In Table 3 , a comparison is made between the transformation strains obtained from MD simulations with theoretically calculated LDM values for the three orientations.",contradiction
"The MD results agree to a good extent, with less than 30% difference between the predicted and theoretically calculated values.",contradiction
"Since the transformation strain is a function of the lattice constants of the two phases, the difference between the LDM and MD values can be attributed to two reasons: 1) the LDM values are calculated from 0 K lattice constants, whereas the B2 and B19? phases in the simulations are at 350 K; and 2) the lattice parameters of B2 and B19? (at 0 K) predicted by the MEAM interatomic potential are not exactly the same as the ab initio values used in the LDM.",contradiction
The consequence of the difference in lattice parameters on the transformation strains has been discussed in Ref. [20].,contradiction
"When the B2 loading direction and the corresponding final variant of B19? are known, the modulus of the two phases can be calculated from elastic constants according to [37,34] (1)EhklB2-1=S11-2S11-S12-12S14n12n22+n22n32+n12n32and(2)EhklB19?-1=n14S11+2n12n22S12+2n12n32S13+2n13n3S15+n24S22+2n22n32S23+2n1n22n3S25+n34S33+2n1n33S35+n22n32S44+2n1n22n3S46+n12n32S55+n12n22S66,where n1,n2 and n3 are cosines of the angles between the direction normal to the (hkl) plane and the lattice vectors of B2 and B19?, respectively, and Sij are the components of the compliance matrix.",contradiction
Wagner and Windl [33] have performed 0 K ab initio calculations and estimated the values of the three elastic constants of B2 and the 13 elastic constants of B19?.,contradiction
"The modulus of B2 along ?110?,?100? and ?111? and the six B19? structures (three in tension and three in compression) can hence be calculated using the values of elastic constants from Ref. [33] in the above formulas.",contradiction
The modulus of the phases obtained from MD is compared with the theoretically calculated 0 K values in Table 4 .,contradiction
The differences between the theoretical moduli and those obtained from MD simulations arise due to the same reasons discussed earlier for the differences in transformation strain values.,contradiction
The next section further describes the effect of temperature on the deformation behavior as predicted by MD simulations.,contradiction
"In various actuators and other electronic devices, a SMA component is subjected to bending.",contradiction
"This type of loading enhances the effect of orientation dependence of the NiTi pseudo-elastic behavior, given that both tensile and compressive loading co-exist.",contradiction
"To analyze this orientation dependence on the structural response, three differently-oriented single-crystal B2 nano-wires are chosen as shown in Fig. 15 (a).",contradiction
"These nano-wires are oriented in such a way that their lengths fall along the ?110?B2,?111?B2 and ?100?B2 directions.",contradiction
Results are shown for a 50 nm long wire with a 10 nm diameter (results similar to those reported here were also observed for larger nano-wires).,contradiction
"After an energy minimization and thermal equilibration at 350 K, the wires are subjected to a bending load by imposing forces on atoms at the two ends of the wires (three unit cells) as shown in Fig. 15(b).",contradiction
"At the end of every step, the force applied is the same on the three nano-wires.",contradiction
The simulations are performed at 350 K where stress-induced transformation occurs.,contradiction
Fig. 16 shows a sectional view of the evolution of the axial strain ?xx along the length of the wire at five different stages of loading.,contradiction
"When the wires are subjected to a bending load, the top part of the wire is stretched while the bottom part is compressed.",contradiction
"This causes a stress-induced B2-B19? transformation in different regions of the wires, and the transformation can be identified through a sudden increase (or decrease) in the axial strain ?xx that manifests as patches of different phases in Fig. 16.",contradiction
"As expected, it is observed that the strain evolution is different in differently-oriented nano-wires.",contradiction
"For instance, in the ?110? and ?111? oriented nano-wires, the tensile stress-induced transformation in the top part of the wires occurs before there is a transformation in the compressive region of the wire, as opposed to the ?100? oriented nano-wire.",contradiction
This can also be visualized at time t=t4 where a larger part of the ?110? and ?111? oriented wires has undergone tensile stress-induced transformation.,contradiction
"Similarly, a very small part of the ?111? oriented wire has undergone a compressive stress-induced transformation.",contradiction
A few conclusions regarding the orientation dependence on the bending behavior can be drawn by correlating the transformation mechanism in the three wires during bending to the values listed in Tables 1 and 2.,contradiction
The B19? transformation stress in tension is lower than the transformation stress in compression along the ?110? and ?111? orientations when compared to the ?100? orientation.,contradiction
"This is directly mirrored by the strain evolution, where the tensile transformation (red patches) happens before the compressive transformation in the ?110? and ?111? nano-wires.",contradiction
The ?111? oriented nano-wire shows the largest difference between the tensile- and the compressive-transformed parts due to the pronounced asymmetry in transformation strain and stress under tension and compression along the ?111? orientation as seen in Tables 1 and 2.,contradiction
"From these tables, the compressive transformation stress along ?111? is observed to be the highest among the six cases (three in tension and three in compression) and this is reflected in the strain evolution in the nano-wires, where the ?111? oriented nano-wire is the wire with the least transformed compressed region.",contradiction
It is concluded that the strain evolution and the progression of transformation when single-crystal nano-wires are subjected to bending is a consequence of the orientation dependence of the single-crystal B2-B19? phase transformation.,contradiction
"Besides the differences observed in the strain evolution and progression of transformation, each of these nano-wires undergoes tensile and compressive stress-induced transformation in the top and bottom parts when subjected to bending thus leading to different martensite variants formed in different parts of the wire.",contradiction
This can be further verified by viewing the nano-wires colored according to a local order parameter [30] as shown in Fig. 17 (a).,contradiction
"Here, only the ?110? oriented nano-wire is shown at a particular time step.",contradiction
The blue colored atoms represent a tensile stress-induced variant and the red colored atoms represent a compressive stress-induced variant.,contradiction
A neutral zone is also seen in between these two regions where phase transformation has not occurred yet and the atoms are colored in green (B2).,contradiction
Similar difference in variants are also observed for the different regions in the other two nano-wires.,contradiction
"In this section, MD simulation results have been presented to show the orientation dependence in the bending behavior of NiTi nano-wires.",contradiction
"When subjected to the same force (at any time step), the bending angle and the tip deformation of the nano-wire is different and depends on the initial orientation of the nano-wire as shown in Fig. 17(b).",contradiction
"This is a result of the difference in variants in the tensile and compressive parts of the three wires, the difference in the progression of phase transformation, and eventually a difference in the strain in the top and bottom parts of the three wires.",contradiction
"In this particular case, from Fig. 17(b), the ?100? oriented nano-wire, which is the orientation along which the compressive transformation strain is the largest and the tensile transformation strain is the smallest, shows the maximum bending as compared to the other two wires.",contradiction
"In comparison, the ?111? oriented nano-wire, which is the orientation with the least compressive transformation strain and the most tensile transformation strain, shows the least bending among the three wires when subjected to the same load.",contradiction
"Although the exact values of bending forces and bending angles during different stages of loading have not been presented here, the crucial aspect to note is that the deformation behavior during bending is a direct consequence of the orientation dependence of the B2-B19? phase transformation in single-crystals.",contradiction
"In this study, MD simulations of uniaxial tensile and compressive loading of three differently-oriented bulk B2 NiTi have been performed.",contradiction
The results indicate a strong orientation dependence and tension-compression asymmetry arising primarily due to the different orientations of the monoclinic crystal structure of the B19? phase.,contradiction
The MD results suggest that the production of single crystal NiTi SMAs can be optimised based on the transformation stress and transformation strain that are needed for a particular application.,contradiction
"For instance, NiTi actuator devices that require large tensile stress-induced deformations can be made in such a way that the ?111? orientation of the B2 single crystal falls along the loading axis.",contradiction
"Similarly, a device that relies on compressive stress-induced transformation would benefit from a ?110? or a ?100? oriented NiTi single crystal.",contradiction
"In the case of bending, one should take into account that the deformation does not occur homogeneously, the curvature of the bended crystal is not constant, and the neutral axis is offset from the center because of the tension-compression asymmetry.",contradiction
This study also lays the basis for a better understanding of polycrystal behavior [18].,contradiction
"When a polycrystal is loaded, the local mechanical behavior will depend on the orientation of the grains.",contradiction
"Transformation will begin earlier in favorably-oriented grains, and the evolution of the martensitic transformation will depend on the size and orientation of individual grains and on the way each grain will deform to accommodate the deformation of its neighbors.",contradiction
The other noticeable difference in behavior for the three orientations is in the nano-structural changes associated with the phase transformation.,contradiction
Earlier MD simulations predicted the formation of Lu?ders-like B19? bands during pseudo-elastic behavior along the ?110? orientation.,contradiction
"In the simulations presented here, the martensitic transformation occurs through the formation of such bands when the austenitic bulk is loaded both along the ?110? or ?100? orientation, whereas the transformation progresses through the formation of a multi-variant B19? structure and the subsequent reorientation into a single-variant B19? when loaded along the ?111? orientation.",contradiction
"Funding: The research leading to these results has been funded through the Shell-NWO/FOM program ?Computational Sciences for energy research? (CSER), project number 12CSER085.",contradiction
The data required to reproduce these findings cannot be shared at this time as the data also forms part of an ongoing study.,contradiction
"Among the numerous application fields of rare earth (RE) oxides, such as luminescence [1,2], high temperature superconductivity [3] and thermoelectricity [4,5], solid state ionics plays a key role.",contradiction
"Even limiting to solid state electrolytes, in fact, several CeO2-based oxides behave as optimal systems: in particular, Sm- and Gd-doped ceria provide remarkable ionic conductivity values in the intermediate temperature range [6?8].",contradiction
"The mechanism underlying ionic conductivity is related to the movement of the oxygen vacancies created by the partial substitution of Ce4+ by RE3+, such as Sm3+, Gd3+, etc., through the lattice.",contradiction
"Yet, the motion is only possible when vacancies present are not associated with RE?Ce, i.e. when they are randomly distributed over the fluorite-type structure typical of CeO2 (hereafter named F, space group: Fm3 ?m), where RE is coordinated to eight oxygen atoms in the nearest-neighbor shell.",contradiction
"The random distribution of vacancies can take place only until the F structure is retained, that is up to a certain substitution range, which depends on the RE identity.",contradiction
"The upper compositional boundary of the F phase in Ce1?x RExO2?x/2 is located, for instance, at x ~ 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 for RE? Gd [9], Sm [10,11] and Lu [12], respectively.",contradiction
"What happens at higher RE content is quite complicated and strongly dependent on the Ce4+/RE3+ size difference [13]: if a sufficient dimensional resemblance exists, such as in the case of RE ? Gd, Sm and Y, an intermediate structure between F and the one typical of sesquioxides RE2O3 of the smallest rare earths becomes stable.",contradiction
"The latter (hereafter called C) crystallizes in the space group Ia3 ?, and it is characterized by the coordination number 6 in the first shell.",contradiction
"The intermediate or hybrid atomic arrangement (H), widely described in the literature for the aforementioned systems [9,10,14,15], consists in a solid solution of C-structured RE2O3 domains embedded within the F matrix, observable by X-ray diffraction in the form of a gradual change of some crystallographic parameters from the values typical of F toward those typical of C.",contradiction
"For RE ? Lu, the Ce4+/RE3+ size difference (rCe4+ [CN8] = 0.97 A?, rLu3+ [CN6] = 0.861 A?, from [16]) is too large to ensure the necessary conditions for the formation of the hybrid atomic arrangement, and for x > 0.4 a (F + C) biphasic field is stable [12].",contradiction
"In spite of the validity of the described scenario, it is well known that the maximum ionic conductivity values in bulk RE-doped ceria occur within the F range, i.e. at x significantly lower than the one corresponding to the F upper boundary [7,17], as a consequence of the formation of C-based nanodomains trapping vacancies at fixed positions, and therefore hindering their free motion.",contradiction
"This interpretation is supported by the results of measurements performed by local techniques, such as Raman [10,12] and EXAFS [18,19] spectroscopy, as well as TEM microscopy [20], which are able to detect the presence of the aforementioned nanodomains, at variance with the x-ray diffraction.",contradiction
"Nevertheless, the composition corresponding to the maximum ionic conductivity, as well as the absolute value of this property, are not necessarily the same in bulk samples and in thin films, due to the presence of heterogeneous interfaces in the latter.",contradiction
"Such aspects are for example elucidated both in experimental and theoretical studies regarding Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2- [21,22] and CeO2-based multilayers [23,24].",contradiction
"In particular, while the presence of a larger amount of defects in thin films with respect to bulk samples determines a remarkable decrease in ionic conductivity [25], the reduction of the layer thickness generally promotes at the same time a significant conductivity increase, which is driven by the controlled interface lattice mismatch between the ionic conductor and the substrate [24,26].",contradiction
"Yet, the difficulty in performing reliable measurements at thin-film interfaces and in correctly evaluating the results by separating the two competing effects (namely the ones deriving from defects and from strain), suggests the possibility to simulate the lattice mismatch effects by following the structural properties of bulk samples subjected to high pressure.",contradiction
"Nonetheless, only few high pressure structural studies of solid state electrolytes are currently available in the literature, such as for example Sm-doped ceria [27].",contradiction
"In this work, Lu-doped ceria is taken as a model to study the high pressure structural features of a system where the effect of oxygen vacancies prevails over the Ce4+/RE3+ size difference in determining the cell parameters of the F phase; this occurs due to the close similarity of the Ce and Lu ionic radii with coordination number 8 (rCe4+ [CN8] = 0.97, rLu3+ [CN8] = 0.977 A?, from [16]), which strongly reduces the dimensional contribution.",contradiction
"Several compositions belonging to the F range of the Ce1?x LuxO2?x/2 system (nominal x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) are studied by high pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction employing a diamond anvil cell (DAC), that is the most commonly used apparatus for high and extremely high pressure diffraction experiments [28].",contradiction
"The applied pressure ranges between 1 and 7 GPa; this choice was operated relying on the evidence that a 1% compressive strain, which is for instance close to the one occurring in a 250 nm thick Gd-doped ceria film deposited on a MgO/SrTiO3 layer [26], roughly corresponds to the application of 5 GPa [27].",contradiction
"Two compositions mainly containing the C phase (nominal x = 0.8 and 0.9) are considered too, with the primary aim to check the C/F amount ratio obtained at ambient and at high pressures; moreover, the composition of the F phase in the (F + C) biphasic sample Ce0.2Lu0.8O1.6, primarily found by x-ray diffraction [12], could be confirmed through the measurement of the bulk modulus.",contradiction
"Data are discussed in terms of the competing factors ruling the bulk modulus of Lu-doped ceria and CeO2, in comparison to results deriving from other RE-doped ceria systems [27,29].",contradiction
High pressure X-ray powder diffraction measurements were carried out at the XRD1 diffraction beamline of the Elettra Synchrotron radiation facility located in Trieste (Italy).,contradiction
A monochromatic circular beam of wavelength 0.7 A? and diameter around 50 ?m was used; pressure was generated using a gear-driven Boehler-Almax plate diamond anvil cell (plate DAC) with a large X-ray opening containing diamonds of culet size 600 ?m.,contradiction

"It consists first of all in the dissolution of due amounts of elemental Ce (Johnson Matthey ALPHA 99.99% wt.) and Lu2O3 in HCl (13% wt.), followed by mixing the two solutions and by adding a solution of oxalic acid in large excess, which causes an immediate precipitation of the mixed Ce/Lu oxalate.",contradiction

"The amount of C increases with increasing x, until this phase becomes the most abundant one at x = 0.6, and the only one from x = 0.9. At x = 0.8, for instance, the sample is formed by the mixture (88 mol% C + 12 mol% F); this evidence suggests the occurrence of out-of-equilibrium conditions, most probably due to a kinetic effect taking place during the oxalate coprecipitation stage, as elucidated in [12].",contradiction

"The observed compositional extent of the F phase in Lu-doped ceria points at a significantly larger stability field than in Gd- and Sm-doped ceria, where F was found stable up to x ~ 0.2 [9] and ~0.3 [10], respectively.",contradiction
"EDS analyses, performed on monophasic samples either with the F (0.1 ? x ? 0.4) or the C structure (x = 0.9), indicate a very good agreement with the nominal Ce/Lu stoichiometry, as evident from Table 1 .",contradiction
"With regard to the biphasic sample Lu80, the ambient pressure compositions of F and C were differently determined: relying on the interpolation of the refined F lattice parameter to the ones of the x = 0.1?0.4 series, the stoichiometry of F results to be Ce0.67Lu0.33O1.83; at variance, the composition of C was fixed at Lu1.8Ce0.2O3.1, i.e. the one corresponding to x = 0.9, since the C cell parameter of Lu80 is very close to the one of Lu90.",contradiction
"In agreement with the previous description, three structural models were refined to properly describe the high pressure crystallographic features of the analyzed samples, namely the F model for samples with x ranging between 0.1 and 0.4, the C model for x = 0.90, and a (F + C) biphasic model for x = 0.80; in particular, for each composition atomic positions refined at ambient pressure [12] were used as the starting values for the refinement of high pressure data.",contradiction
"The peak profile was described for each diffractogram by a pseudo-Voigt function, the background was optimized by fitting a set of ~70 points taken from the pattern, and for almost each diffraction pattern the atomic isotropic displacement parameters (Biso) were optimized too.",contradiction
"The cationic ratio was set at the values found as previously described and not allowed to vary; in the last refinement cycle, structural parameters (lattice parameters, and in the C phase the Ce/Lu x coordinate and the O x, y and z coordinates), atomic Biso, the scale factor, five peak parameters, two asymmetry parameters and the background points, were refined.",contradiction
"Fig. 1 shows the Rietveld refinement plot of sample Lu40_4.32 as an example; Table 1 reports the pressure applied to each sample and the corresponding refined lattice parameters, along with the agreement factors RB of each phase and ?2.",contradiction
"The diffraction patterns of Lu10 and Lu90 collected at all the pressure values are shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b) as representative examples of the behavior of phases F and C, respectively.",contradiction
"It can be observed that no structural transitions occur up to the maximum applied pressure; a regular shift of all the diffraction peaks toward higher 2? values with increasing pressure takes place in both phases, as highlighted by the dashed vertical lines appearing in the panels.",contradiction
"By closer inspection, it can be also noticed that peaks present a progressive broadening and intensity decrease with increasing the applied pressure, which are typical of high-pressure data (see for example refs [27,34].).",contradiction
In Fig. 3 cell volumes are plotted for phase F as a function of pressure: in the range considered the decreasing trend can be properly fit by the regression lines drawn in the figure.,contradiction
"It is noteworthy that the high pressure cell volumes from the different samples follow the same sequence as at ambient pressure; moreover, data of sample Lu80 are located between the ones of Lu30 and Lu40, what confirms the substantial correctness of the Lu content attribution (x = 0.33), done relying on ambient pressure structural data [12].",contradiction
"No compressibility anomalies can be detected, at variance with the behavior of nanometric Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9, which points at a negative pressure effect above 15 GPa [27]: it was attributed to the non-homogeneity of silicon oil acting as a PTM at pressures higher than 13 GPa [35], causing a loss of hydrostaticity.",contradiction
Regression lines fitting the trends of cell volumes are visible in Fig. 3.,contradiction
"Numerical values from the fit, as well as the corresponding r2 values, are collected in Table 2 .",contradiction
"Based on these data, it is possible to estimate the bulk modulus (B0) of the F phase occurring at the different compositions (0.1 ? x ? 0.4), which is defined as(1)B0=?VdPdVP=0where V is the cell volume at P = 0.",contradiction
"The bulk modulus accounts for the ability of a material to resist against compression, and its reciprocal represents the compressibility of the material.",contradiction
"In Fig. 4 the obtained B0 values are reported as a function of the Lu content, together with the one of CeO2 retrieved from the literature [36]: it can be observed that the bulk modulus presents a trend to grow going from CeO2 to Lu20, while it linearly decreases at higher x.",contradiction
"It is noteworthy to observe that the bulk modulus of the F phase contained in Lu80, set at x = 0.33, excellently fits into the linear trend, which further corroborates the correctness of the Lu amount attribution based on the results of ambient pressure x-ray diffraction.",contradiction
It is also worth highlighting that the bulk modulus determined using a fit to the pressure-volume data using a second order Birch-Murnaghan equation also yielded a trend similar to that shown in Fig. 4.,contradiction
"Moreover, the trend presented in Fig. 4 holds true even if a slightly higher value for the CeO2 bulk modulus (230 GPa, from ref. [37]) is used.",entailment
"The twofold behavior observed in the bulk modulus dependence vs. x (see Fig. 4) can be interpreted by taking into account the most relevant factor contributing to the elastic properties of oxides, namely the mean atomic volume.",contradiction
"According to the paper by Anderson and Nafe [38], in fact, an inverse correlation exists between the bulk modulus of a metal oxide and its mean atomic volume; in systems such as doped ceria, where the total number of atoms changes with composition, this evidence means that the emptying of the structure, which crucially contributes to the mean atomic volume, is a significant factor in the calculation of the bulk modulus.",contradiction
"As evident from Fig. 5 , the mean atomic volume of Lu-doped ceria shows a linearly increasing trend as a function of the Lu content; an inverse correlation can be thus observed with the bulk modulus values within the 0.2?0.4 x range, meaning that the introduction of vacancies plays a key role in this compositional interval.",contradiction
"At lower x values, on the contrary, the slightly increasing behavior of B0 accounts for the decreasing trend of the lattice parameter vs. the Lu content, thus indicating that the emptying of the structure becomes effective above a certain vacancies amount, while at lower Lu amount the effect of the lattice size prevails; thus, below this threshold the bulk modulus acts as not perceiving the presence of vacancies.",contradiction
"Besides, non-associated V O ..",contradiction
"vacancies, which are typical of the F phase and dominate over C-based domains (Lu?Ce : V O ..) in Lu-doped ceria at x ? 0.4, are supposed to favor an increase in compressibility of the whole atomic arrangement by causing the emptying of the structure.",contradiction
"Therefore, the dual behavior observed in the trend of the cell volume can be considered as the result of the two described competing effects, with the contribution of vacancies dominating from x > ~0.2. Relying on a recent work of this research group [39], where a method based on Raman spectroscopy was proposed to evaluate the RE coordination number in doped ceria, x = 0.2 in the Lu-containing system roughly corresponds to Lu coordination number 7.5, which means that 75% of Lu atoms have coordination number 8 and 25% of them have coordination number 6.",contradiction
This result is in good agreement with data obtained from an EXAFS study on the same system [40].,contradiction
"Therefore, 7.5 represents a threshold, below which the presence of vacancies reflects on the bulk modulus; above this value, on the contrary, they do not significantly affect it.",contradiction
"With reference to the mean atomic volume of the Lu-doped ceria system vs. the Lu content (Fig. 5), it is interesting to notice that the value associated to the F phase of sample Lu80 well fits into the regression line, again confirming the accuracy of the composition found by x-ray diffraction.",contradiction
"If a comparison is made between Lu-doped ceria and other similar systems, it can be concluded that the decrease in B0 also occurs in Sm- [27] and in Gd- [29] doped ceria.",contradiction
"Moreover, it is noteworthy that the bulk modulus of Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 (157 GPa, from [27]) is significantly lower than the ones of both CeO2 (220 GPa, [36]) and Ce0.8Lu0.2O1.9 (251 GPa, this work).",entailment
"This evidence is in good agreement with the fact that at a given x the mean atomic volume is larger in Sm-doped ceria than in Lu-doped ceria (see Fig. 5); moreover, the trends of both the lattice parameter and the mean atomic volume show a linear increase vs. the Sm content [10,12], so that the two aforementioned effects are not competing.",contradiction
"Similarly to what was observed in this work, even in Gd-doped ceria the bulk modulus shows a linear decrease with increasing the Gd amount, which can be explained analogously to Sm-doped ceria (see Fig. 5); this behaviour is essentially different from the one of other moduli, such as the Young's and shear modulus, which display data lying above the linear fit observed up to x = 0.2, and consequently point at a stiffening of the structure at higher x [29].",contradiction
"The latter effect has been attributed to the presence of the previously described C-based nanodomains revealed in Gd-doped ceria by different techniques [39,41], causing a reduction of the RE-O interatomic distances within the nearest-neighbor coordination shell [29].",contradiction
"Interestingly, both in Gd- and Lu-containing systems the bulk modulus seems not to experience the presence of C nanodomains, which in Gd- and Lu-doped ceria are revealed by ?-Raman spectroscopy for x ? 0.2 [10] and x ? 0.3 [12], respectively.",contradiction
"At this stage it is interesting to notice that, at variance with the bulk modulus, the elastic modulus is commonly reported to be inversely proportional to the cell volume rather than to the mean atomic volume [29].",contradiction
"As an example, when oxygen is subtracted from CeO2 or Ce1?x GdxO2?x/2 (for instance by treating samples at 1073 K at oxygen partial pressure lower than 10?17 atm [42], which causes a significant off-stoichiometry), a certain amount of Ce4+ (rCe4+, CN8 = 0.97 A? [16]) is reduced to Ce3+ (rCe3+, CN8 = 1.143 A? [16]) to counterbalance the oxygen depletion; as a consequence of the increase in the average ionic size and the reduction of the Coulomb interaction, the lattice parameter remarkably increases.",contradiction
This effect induces the decrease of the elastic modulus with decreasing PO2 which is widely documented in the literature [42?44].,contradiction
"An analogous decrease is revealed in Y-, Gd- and Sm-doped ceria as a function of the RE content, but only up to a certain dopant concentration (10?20% mol Ce substitution) [45,46]; at higher doping ion content, on the contrary, it starts increasing even if the vacancies amount further increases, meaning that the elastic modulus value is bound not only to the vacancies content.",contradiction
"Besides, the effect of lattice expansion is not such a straightforward consequence of the increase in the vacancies amount; on the contrary, in the literature the introduction of vacancies is described as responsible for a lattice swelling [42,44,47?50], but also for a lattice shrinkage [51?56].",contradiction
"This apparent contradiction deals with the numerous factors which accompany the vacancies introduction and contribute to the CeO distance: among these, the partial substitution of Ce4+ by a trivalent ion, the weakening of the Coulomb interaction due to the oxygen depletion, and the introduction of vacancies itself.",contradiction
"Anyway, when a separation between the effect of RE size and of vacancies is operated, for example by properly treating the F2g CeO Raman symmetric vibration mode [56], the latter generally reveal to cause a lattice shrinkage, such as in the case of Sm-and Gd-doped ceria [10,12].",contradiction
"Moreover, a significant decrease of the lattice size has been observed by x-ray diffraction in Lu-doped ceria as a function of the dopant content [12].",contradiction
"This effect cannot be explained as a consequence of the Ce4+/Lu3+ dimensional difference, being the two cations nearly identical (rCe4+ [CN8] = 0.97, rLu3+ [CN8] = 0.977 A?, from [16]), but most probably as an outcome of the increasing vacancies amount.",contradiction
"Hence, it can be concluded that the elastic modulus behaves in an essentially different way with respect to the bulk modulus, being the former strictly bound to all the factors contributing to the lattice size rather than just to the presence and the amount of oxygen vacancies.",contradiction
The high pressure structural features of several compositions belonging to the Ce1?x LuxO2?x/2 system were investigated by synchrotron x-ray diffraction coupled to a diamond anvil cell.,contradiction
"The main conclusion which can be drawn from the results of the present study is that the trend of the bulk modulus as a function of the Lu content results to be determined by two competing factors, namely the mean atomic volume for x ranging between 0.2 and 0.4, and the lattice volume at lower x; this result suggests that oxygen vacancies affect the bulk modulus value above x ~ 0.2. Moreover, the bulk modulus seems to be independent of the presence of C-based nanodomains which are stable within the F structure starting from x ? 0.3. The observed trend is in agreement with data of Sm- and Gd-doped ceria available in the literature.",contradiction

"They speculated that hydrogen would occupy not only the T site but also half of the O site to achieve 2.5 H/M, while hydrogen occupies only the T site in the di-hydride of the conventional ternary BCC alloys.",contradiction
"Therefore, these findings are attractive to develop and design new hydrogen storage materials with the BCC structure that have a higher hydrogen capacity.",contradiction

"Therefore, it is thought that the lattice distortion itself does not influence the maximum hydrogen capacity of BCC alloys, and the reason why hydrogen capacity of Nbx(Ti0.7Cr0.3)1-x did not reach to 2.5 H/M is not related to the smaller lattice distortion.",contradiction
"Next, we would like to discuss a factor controlling equilibrium pressures.",contradiction
Both the lattice constants of an alloy phase and the equilibrium pressure increase with an increase in the Nb content.,contradiction
This is the opposite tendency of the well-known inverse relationship of equilibrium pressure to lattice constant.,contradiction
The equilibrium pressures that we consider in BCC alloys corresponds to the phase transformation from the mono-hydride to the di-hydride.,contradiction

The logarithmic equilibrium pressures have a linear relationship with the bulk modulus per cell volume.,contradiction

"This is consistent with the results obtained by Long et al. and Li et al. [21?23] Although YCrO4 in zircon phase has high lattice energy, its bulk modulus is lower than YCrO4 in scheelite phase.",contradiction
These results are not contradiction according to our theory because the bulk modulus of a crystal depends on the lattice energy density instead of lattice energy.,contradiction
"The lattice energy decreases when YCrO4 undergoes a structure transition from zircon to scheelite, while at the same time, the cell volume reduces greatly from 78.91A?3 to 70.48A?3.",contradiction

"From the viewpoint of energy, some quantitative conclusion might be drawn on the deformation behavior of RE?O and Cr?O bonds.",contradiction
"Since the lattice energies of RE?O bonds are less than those of the Cr?O bonds, it is easy to understand that RE?O bonds are softer than Cr?O bonds, therefore RE?O bonds are easier to deform than Cr?O bonds when the crystal are heated or under pressure.",contradiction
This conclusion is confirmed by the calculated LTEC and bulk modulus of the bonds.,contradiction
The calculated LTECs and bulk moduli of the compounds are also listed in Table 1.,contradiction

We would like to ascribe this result to the different coordination number of Y.,contradiction
"In BaY2O4 and SrY2O4 compounds, Y has a coordination number of 6, while in YCrO4 the coordination number of Y is 8.",contradiction
This naturally leads to the fact that the population of electrons on Y?O bonds in YCrO4 is less than that in BaY2O4 and SrY2O4.,contradiction

"Carbon transport and storage in the deep Earth interior have attracted in recent years the attention of researches because of a growing recognition of their key importance for the global carbon cycle and their influence on (e.g. Burton et al., 2013).",contradiction
"Two processes of particular relevance are the transport of carbon into the Earth interior (ingassing) through slab subductions and the outgassing of carbon via magmatic and volcanic processes (e.g. Hazen et al., 2012).",contradiction
"Based on the geochemical and petrological estimates on the carbon contents of the mantle-derived carbonated samples, the total carbon budget in the planet's mantle can be in the order of (0.8?12.5)ž1023 g of C, whereas the amount of carbon in the near-surface reservoirs, including the crust, oceans, and atmosphere is in the order of (8.4?10.2)ž1022 g of C (Hirschmann and Dasgupta, 2009; Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2010).",contradiction
"Therefore, Earth's mantle is likely the largest carbon reservoir of the planet, in which the mass of the deep-mantle carbon can well exceed that in all other carbon reservoirs.",contradiction
"As a result of the variable pressure?temperature (P?T) and oxygen fugacity conditions in the Earth's interior, deep-mantle carbon can exist in a number of forms including CO2-rich and hydrocarbon-rich fluids/melts, accessory minerals (carbonates, diamond, and graphite), iron carbides, among others (Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2010; Kaminsky and Wirth, 2011).",contradiction

"Calcite and dolomite carbonates (CaCO3 and (Ca,Mg)CO3), however, are stable only at P?T conditions at shallower parts of the upper mantle, e.g., at depth above ?120 km (?4 GPa); though, recent studies have suggested that these minerals can remain stable at higher P?T conditions within the Earth (Oganov et al., 2006; Mao et al., 2011).",contradiction
"On the other hand, recent experimental and theoretical studies on the phase diagram of magnesite have shown that magnesite remains stable in the MgCO3 form at expected P?T conditions of the lower mantle, whereas new high-pressure phases of magnesite have been reported to occur at lowermost-mantle conditions (Isshiki et al., 2004; Oganov et al., 2008; Boulard et al., 2011), making magnesite a potential major deep-carbon host in the deeper parts of the mantle.",contradiction
"Furthermore, observations of carbonate inclusions in natural diamonds thought to be originated from the lower mantle further support the notion that magnesite can be a major deep-carbon host (Brenker et al., 2007).",contradiction
"Most recent results also show that magnesite can be formed from reactions of MgO and CO2 at P?T conditions of the Earth's mantle (Scott et al., 2013).",contradiction
"Therefore, studying the physical and chemical properties of magnesite under relevant P?T conditions of the mantle can hold the key to our understanding of the global carbon cycle as well as to identifying potential carbonate-rich regions in the deep Earth interior.",contradiction
Of particular importance to seismic and geochemical modeling of the deep-Earth carbonates is the high P?T elasticity of magnesite at relevant conditions of the Earth's mantle.,contradiction
Laboratory measurements on the sound velocities of magnesite and other carbonates at ambient conditions have been used to assess the seismic detectability of carbonated eclogite and peridotite in the upper mantle.,contradiction
"These studies have suggested that moderately carbonated regions may be difficult to detect seismically (Sanchez-Valle et al., 2011).",contradiction
"Nevertheless, high P?T effects on the sound velocities of magnesite remain mostly unavailable; specifically, the pressure effect on the sound velocities of magnesite have been measured only up to 1 GPa (Christensen, 1972) and there are not yet published high-temperature data.",contradiction
"Here we have measured the compressional wave (VP) and shear wave (VS) velocities of single-crystal magnesite using Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) Spectroscopy in a high-pressure diamond anvil cell (DAC) up to 13.7 GPa at 300 K and up to 750 K at ambient pressure, respectively.",contradiction
"Based on the experimentally-measured velocities, we have derived the full elastic stiffness tensor and have modeled the elasticity and elastic anisotropies of magnesite at expected upper-mantle P?T conditions.",contradiction
These results are applied to understand the potential effects of magnesite on the seismic profiles and anisotropies in carbonated eclogite and peridotite in the upper mantle.,contradiction
Our modeled velocity profiles provide mineral physics references and constraints for future seismic detections of potentially carbonated regions in the Earth's interior.,contradiction

Cleaved platelets showing high optical clarity and surface smoothness were selected for BLS measurements.,contradiction
Some cleaved platelets when screened for BLS spectral quality and were found to contain polysynthetic twinning that showed up in BLS spectra with two VP peaks at certain given orientations; these samples and their BLS spectra were eventually discarded.,contradiction
High-pressure BLS measurements were conducted on single-crystal magnesite without the polysynthetic twinning in a DAC in the Mineral Physics Laboratory of the University of Texas at Austin.,contradiction
"A single-crystal platelet with a diameter of 150 ?m and thickness of 35 ?m was loaded into the sample chamber of a short symmetrical DAC with a pair of diamond culets of 400 ?m having Ne as the pressure medium and ruby spheres as the pressure calibrant (Mao et al., 1986).",contradiction

The sample was sealed in a pre-indented and drilled hole of the sample chamber in the Re gasket to prevent any potential chemical reaction with air.,contradiction
"An R-type thermocouple was attached to one of the diamond's surface approximately 500 ?m away from its culet for temperature measurements; such experimental geometry permitted temperature uncertainties of within 1 K within our experiments (Sinogeikin et al., 2006).",contradiction
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction patterns of the magnesite were also collected using a CCD detector in order to determine the lattice parameters and hence density of the sample at high temperatures.,contradiction
Brillouin spectra of magnesite were collected up to 14 GPa at room temperature in a 1?3 GPa pressure interval and up to 750 K at room pressure.,contradiction
The BLS spectra were collected in the {101 ?1} plane in approximately 19 to 37 different crystallographic directions (at approximately 5 to 10 degrees interval) for each given P?T condition.,contradiction
"Most of the spectra showed strong VP and two polarized VS peaks with high signal-to-noise ratios, although the VP or VS peaks were weaker in a number of directions as expected due to the intrinsic anisotropy of the elasto-optic coupling in trigonal magnesite (Nelson et al., 1972) (Fig. 1 ).",contradiction
"Brillouin signals of the Ne pressure medium were also observed at pressures below 8 GPa, but they were not as visible at higher pressures.",contradiction
"The measured VP and VS varied significantly as a function of the azimuthal angle, immediately indicating strong elastic anisotropies of the sample at high P and high T (Fig. 2 ).",contradiction
"Since the VP and VS are intrinsically a function of crystallographic direction and deriving the full elastic constants requires the knowledge of the sample's density, we have followed a nonlinear inversion procedure proposed previously to solve the six elastic constants of the rhombohedral magnesite using the Christoffel's equations with initial densities from an equation of state (EoS) of magnesite (Every, 1980; Chen et al., 2001; Litasov et al., 2008; Sanchez-Valle et al., 2011).",contradiction
Excellent agreement is found between the measured and calculated sound velocities from the best-fit elastic model at ambient and high P?T conditions (Fig. 2).,contradiction
The derived single-crystal elastic constants of magnesite at ambient conditions are consistent with previous results within experimental errors validating our nonlinear inversion model for deriving the elastic constants of magnesite at high P and high T (Tables S1 and S2).,contradiction

"The derived adiabatic bulk (KS0) and shear moduli (G0) are at ambient conditions are 114.7 (ñ1.3) and 69.9 (ñ0.6) GPa, respectively.",entailment
An iterative procedure was adopted to further obtain the finite strain parameters for individual and aggregate elastic moduli as well as densities at high pressure.,contradiction
"The pressure derivatives of the elastic moduli at 300 K were obtained by fitting the moduli at high pressure using the third-order Eulerian finite-strain equation of state (EoS) (Birch, 1978):KS=KS0(1+2f)5/2{1+[3((?KS/?P)T?5)f]}, G=(1+2f)5/2[G0+(3KS0(?G/?P)T?5G0)f], f=(1/2)[(V0/V)2/3?1], where (?KS/?P)T and (?G/?P)T are the pressure derivative of the KS and G at 300 K, respectively, f is the Eulerian strain, and V0 and V are unit-cell volume at ambient pressure and high pressure, respectively.",contradiction
"The derived KS and (?KS/?P)T were further converted to the isothermal bulk modulus (KT) and its pressure derivative at constant temperature (?KT/?P)T using the following thermodynamic relations (Poirier, 2000):KT0=KS0/(1+??T), (?KT/?P)T=(1+??T)?1[(?KS/?P)T??T/KT0(?KT/?T)P], where (?KT/?T)P is the temperature derivative of the KT at constant pressure, KT0 is the isothermal bulk modulus at ambient conditions, ? is the thermal expansion coefficient, and ? is the Gru?neisen parameter.",contradiction

"The aggregate VP and VS velocities at high P?T conditions (Fig. 5 ) were also calculated using:VP=KS+43G?,VS=G?.",contradiction
The measured elastic constants of magnesite at high P?T permit us to evaluate its azimuthal velocity anisotropy which describes the velocity as a function of the wave propagation direction (Fig. 6 ).,contradiction
"The VP and VS velocities propagation normal and parallel to the rotation axis show that VP travels fastest along the [2,1 ?,1 ?,0] direction and slowest along the rotation c-axis, indicating that the c-axis is the most compliant orientation.",contradiction
"Furthermore, the VS1 is slowest along the [2,1 ?,1 ?,0] direction and fastest along the c-axis, while VS2 propagates fastest along the [0,1 ?,1,0] and slowest along the [2,1 ?,1 ?,0] direction.",contradiction
These results immediately show extremely strong VP and VS anisotropies of magnesite.,contradiction
"The azimuthal VP and VS anisotropies can also be analyzed using the anisotropy factor (Mainprice et al., 2000).",contradiction
"The anisotropy factor for VP (AP) is defined as:AP=2ž(VP,max?VP,min)/(VP,max+VP,min)ž100%, where VP,max and VP,min represent the maximum and minimum VP velocities of the mineral, respectively.",contradiction

"Based on our high P?T elasticity results for single-crystal magnesite, we have calculated the aggregate VP and VS profiles of magnesite using the Voigt?Reuss?Hill averages along an expected geotherm for cold subducted slabs and for the normal upper mantle, respectively (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981; Brown and Shankland, 1981; Peacock, 2003) (Fig. 8 ).",contradiction
"For direct comparison, seismic profiles of major minerals in upper-mantle eclogite and peridotite rock assemblages were calculated including olivine (Isaak, 1992; Zha et al., 1998; Liu and Li, 2006), clinopyroxene (Cameron, 1973; Finger and Ohashi, 1976; Duffy and Anderson, 1989; Collins and Brown, 1998), orthopyroxene (Chai et al., 1997; Jackson et al., 2003, 2007), and garnet (Thieblot et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2013) (Fig. 8).",contradiction

"Briefly, these values were further evaluated along a normally expected upper-mantle geotherm (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981; Brown and Shankland, 1981) and a cold slab geotherm (Peacock, 2003) by extrapolating the experimentally-derived elastic moduli and their P?T derivatives to relevant P?T conditions using the third-order Eulerian finite-strain and Birch?Murnaghan EoS (Birch, 1978).",contradiction
"Our modeled P?T conditions focus on the upper-mantle region ranging from 200-km to 410-km depth, because the mineralogical, geochemical, and seismic heterogeneities above 200 km depth are much more complex (Jordan, 1975; Grand and Helmberger, 1984; Hofmann, 2003).",contradiction
"Specifically, the existence of the low-velocity zone at approximately 200 km depth would require further considerations of a partially-melted mantle model (Zhao et al., 1992; Webb and Forsyth, 1998).",contradiction
"Our modeled velocities show that magnesite and clinopyroxene have the lowest VP and VS among all mantle minerals along a normal geotherm, while garnet has the highest velocity.",contradiction
"Along a cold slab geotherm, however, the VP and VS velocities of magnesite are closer to that of olivine, rather than that of clinopyroxene with the lowest velocity profiles.",contradiction
This difference can be understood in terms of the sensitivity of the elastic moduli of magnesite to change in temperature that is larger than that of the aforementioned major mantle minerals.,contradiction
"The dK/dT and dG/dT of magnesite are ?0.024(ñ0.002) GPa/K and ?0.0148(ñ0.0007) GPa/K, respectively, while clinopyroxene has dK/dT=?0.013 GPa/K and dG/dT=?0.01 GPa/K (Duffy and Anderson, 1989).",contradiction
"Considering the average Fe/Mg molar ratio of approximately 0.12 in the Earth's mantle (McDonough and Sun, 1995), magnesite is expected to contain approximately 15 wt.% iron in the upper mantle (e.g. Dasgupta et al., 2004).",contradiction
"The addition of 15 wt.% iron in magnesite is expected to decrease the velocity profiles by 3?4% at ambient condition (Sanchez-Valle et al., 2011), although the effect of iron on the elasticity of magnesite at high P?T conditions remains to be further investigated (Lin et al., 2012).",contradiction
"To further evaluate the effect of carbonate presence on the seismic velocity profiles of the Earth's upper mantle and to place constraints on the seismic detectability of the deep-mantle carbonate, we have also calculated the velocity profiles of eclogite and peridotite containing 5 wt.% CO2 in the form of magnesite (Fig. 9 ).",contradiction
"Here we have used the mineral proportions reported for carbonated eclogite (Dasgupta et al., 2004) and peridotite (Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2006) as representative references for comparisons of the velocity profiles.",contradiction
"The mineral assemblage in carbon-free eclogite model includes approximately 53.3 wt.% garnet and 46.7 wt.% clinopyroxene, while carbon-free peridotite includes 59.3 wt.% olivine, 12.8 wt.% clinopyroxene, 11.4 wt.% orthopyroxene, and 16.5 wt.% garnet.",contradiction
"5 wt.% CO2 (10 wt.% MgCO3 in eclogite and 10 wt.% in peridotite) content in the form of magnesite was used in the compositional modeling as a carbonated eclogite and peridotite in order to better understand the sensitivity of the carbonation effects, although these rock assemblages are expected to contain much less CO2 (Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2010).",contradiction
"Our modeled results along a normally expected geotherm (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981; Brown and Shankland, 1981) show that addition of 5 wt.% CO2 decreases the VP and VS by less than 1%, while the change is less than 0.5% along an expected geotherm for a cold subducted slab (Peacock, 2003) (Fig. 9).",contradiction
"We note that standard propagations of the errors involved in these calculations show that the standard deviation (ñ?) in the VP and VS values is approximately 2% (Fig. 9), meaning that these changes in the VP and VS profiles are all within the uncertainty and can be considered as negligible from a mineral physics prospective.",contradiction
"Recent geophysical and geochemical studies have shown that peridotite and eclogite are the most likely rock assemblages in deeper upper mantle and subduction zones (Nicolas and Christensen, 1987; Johnson et al., 1990; Spandler et al., 2003), respectively, in which they may contain amounts of CO2 in the form of accessory iron-bearing magnesite, ferromagnesite, with approximately 15 wt.% iron (e.g. Dasgupta et al., 2004).",contradiction
"Ferromagnesite can be transported into these regions through the subduction of carbonate minerals in subducted slabs, and remains stable as a major deep-carbon host (Luth, 1999).",contradiction
Our modeled velocity profiles of magnesite at relevant P?T conditions of the upper mantle indicate that the existence of 5 wt.% CO2 in the form of magnesite only produces less than 1% reductions in VP and VS velocities as compared to the carbon-free counterparts.,contradiction
"Considering the uncertainties in our results as well as seismic models, we thus conclude that seismic observations of the moderately carbonated regions that are of relevant geochemical abundances in the upper mantle will be challenging.",contradiction
"An electronic high-spin to low-spin transition of iron has been recently reported to occur in ferromagnesite (Mg0.35Fe0.65)CO3 at approximately 45 GPa (?1000 km in depth) (Lin et al., 2012, 2013).",contradiction
"The transition of iron in ferromagnesite from the high-spin to the low-spin state results in a density increase by approximately 6% and an incompressibility increase by 8% (Lavina et al., 2009, 2010; Lin et al., 2012, 2013), indicating that low-spin ferromagnesite can become relatively denser than the high-spin counterpart below the middle part of the lower mantle.",contradiction
"Changes in the sound velocities within the spin transition of iron in the lower-mantle ferropericlase have also been reported recently (e.g. Lin et al., 2013; Marquardt et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2013).",contradiction
"It is thus conceivable that the spin transition can also affect the sound velocities of ferromagnesite, influencing the modeled seismic profiles presented here.",contradiction
"Our modeled results for elastic anisotropies show that magnesite exhibits approximately 37?41% VP anisotropy and 46?49% VS splitting anisotropy at upper-mantle P?T conditions, making it the highest anisotropic mineral when compared with other major mantle minerals (Fig. S1).",contradiction
"Furthermore, the anisotropies of magnesite increase with increasing P?T (depth) that is in contrast to most other major upper-mantle minerals.",contradiction
"Given the fact that carbonates (e.g. calcite, magnesite, dolomite) are markedly weaker in creep strength than other major minerals in peridotite and eclogite assemblages (Schneider, 1976; Karato, 1989) and that they tend to develop fabrics under deviatoric stress or plastic flow conditions (Schmid et al., 1987; Rutter et al., 1994), it is thus possible that seismic velocity anisotropies can be used as a diagnostic feature for detections of the highly carbonated materials containing textured magnesite in the Earth's mantle.",contradiction
"Recent studies have indeed demonstrated that carbonation of peridotite may produce high seismic anisotropy due to the high elastic anisotropy of carbonate minerals (Brownlee et al., 2013).",contradiction
"Recent results on the lattice preferred orientation (LPO) or fabrics have shown that calcite can develop a moderately strong crystallographic preferred orientation with the c-axes sub-perpendicular to a foliation developed during localized high-pressure deformations (Brady et al., 2004), which can be used as an analog to understand the deformation of magnesite in the mantle.",contradiction
"If magnesite develops similar fabrics in the carbonated peridotite and eclogite, its minimum P-wave velocity would likely be normal to the foliation while the maximum shear wave splitting will be sub-parallel to the foliation.",contradiction
Future studies on the deformation mechanism of magnesite in the carbonated eclogite and peridotite at relevant P?T condition are needed to shed new light on the role of the magnesite carbonate on seismic anisotropies of the Earth's upper mantle.,contradiction

The two trend lines are characterized by different degree of compression.,contradiction
Referring to the phases with a lower compression the linear relationship could be assigned to M2+M13+Si2O6 clinopyroxenes with Na at M2 site and trivalent cations at M1 site while the second trend corresponding to the pyroxenes with higher compression can be related to M22+M12+Si2O6 with Ca at M2 site and divalent cations at M1 site.,contradiction
"In order to confirm if the trends described by [11] can really predict the volume compression of such clinopyroxenes, in Fig. 4 we plotted the V/V 0 versus V 0 for the NaMnSi2O6 sample studied in this work.",contradiction

Significant peak broadening and intensity reduction of the Bragg peaks with increasing pressure was observed.,contradiction
The broadening and intensity reduction can be attributed to a strain distribution within the sample in non- and quasi-hydrostatic conditions.,contradiction
The bulk modulus of SDC20 has been calculated from high pressure diamond anvil cell measurements when tested with and without PTM.,contradiction
The bulk modulus value calculated from the SDC20 sample measurements with silicon oil PTM (156.92GPa) is the most accurate experimental data due to the near-hydrostatic pressure acting on the sample during measurements.,entailment

The volume elastic energy of the film is given by Eq. (4) [16].,contradiction
As the modulus of the material decreases the film volume elastic energy decreases and misfit dislocation formation decreases.(4)Film volume elastic energy=Young'smodulus*film thickness*coherency strain As bulk modulus of the material decreases (increasing elasticity of the material) a larger strain can be accommodated in the lattice (before misfit dislocation generation) causing enhanced lattice expansion and faster ionic transport through the lattice.,contradiction

An inspection of the difference-Fourier maps of the electron density showed a significant degree of disorder in the distribution of the extra-framework population along these channels.,contradiction
"In this light, the position of K(3), K(4) and Ca(3), along with those of W(11), W(12) and W(13), should be considered as tentative.",contradiction
We cannot exclude that their electron density maxima could be also due to truncation effect of the Fourier-series.,contradiction
"The chemical formula deduced on the basis of the structure refinement is (K4.2Ca2.0Ba0.3)?6.5T24O84ú20H2O, showing a deficit of the cationic and molecular population if compared to the EPMA-WDS data [i.e., with (Na0.37K4.98Mg0.04Ca3.19Sr0.03Ba0.23)?8.74 and 22.2H2O].",contradiction
"This comparative analysis corroborates the suspect that additional H2O sites and cationic sites, with very low site occupancies, are missed in the structure model here presented.",contradiction
"A drastically lower compressibility is observed when the zeolite is compressed in methanol:ethanol or, even more markedly, in methanol:ethanol:water mix if compared to the compressional pattern in silicone-oil.",contradiction
"We can ascribe this phenomenon to the different crystal?fluid interaction at high pressure: (1) silicone-oil is a ?non-penetrating? P-medium, because of its polymeric nature, whereas (2) methanol-ethanol and water are potentially ?penetrating? P-fluids [12?14].",contradiction
"The kinetic diameters of H2O, methanol and ethanol, and the maximum diameter of a sphere that can diffuse through the paulingite cavities (i.e., 4.07A?), suggest that at least H2O and methanol are potentially penetrating molecules.",contradiction
"However, we cannot exclude that at high pressure even ethanol behaves as penetrating molecule.",contradiction
"When molecules belonging to the P-fluid penetrate through the zeolitic cavities in response to the applied pressure, they act as extra-filler of the channels (or cages), making the zeolite less compressible because the cavities are more efficiently stuffed.",contradiction
"Among the potentially penetrating molecules used in our experiments, H2O is the smallest one in kinetic diameter and thus the most penetrating one.",contradiction
This can explain the lower compressibility of paulingite when compressed in methanol:ethanol:water mix if compared to the compression in methanol:ethanol mix.,contradiction
"Previous experiments on P-induced penetration of external H2O molecules showed that this unusual phenomenon can give rise to: (1) new extra-framework sites, with significant change of the configuration of the extra-framework population (e.g., in fibrous zeolites or in laumontite, [31,32]) or (2) increasing the occupancy factors of sites partly occupied at room P without new sites (e.g., [33]).",contradiction
"The first case usually produces a P-induced expansion of the unit-cell volume, with a discontinuity in the evolution of V vs. P.",contradiction
"In the second case, the evolution of V vs. P follows a continuous trend.",contradiction
"In paulingite, the scenario is more complex: the penetration process involves H2O and also methanol (and ethanol).",contradiction
"Despite the compressional patterns appear to be continuous in methanol:ethanol and methanol:ethanol:water mix, we are forced to consider that new extra-framework sites occur at high pressure, populated by methanol (or ethanol) atoms.",contradiction
"The extra H2O molecules likely increase the occupancy factors of H2O-sites partially occupied at room P, but we cannot exclude the occurrence of new H2O sites at high pressure.",contradiction
"The lack of the structure refinements at high pressure does not allow any speculation about the amount of P-fluids molecules penetrated in response to the applied pressure, neither their location into the structure voids.",contradiction
"The X-ray diffraction data confirm that the penetration of methanol, ethanol and H2O does not change the long-range order of the structure, thus the lattice properties are kept preserved within the P-range investigated, and the zeolite does not reveal a mechanically-induced structural collapse as commonly manifested by pressure-induced amorphization.",contradiction
"The patterns observed by X-ray diffraction in compression and decompression, with the mentioned penetrating P-fluids, show no clear evidence of partial reversibility of the P-induced penetration phenomena, within the limits of experimental accuracy.",contradiction
The P-induced penetration processes appear to be completely reversible on the basis of the X-ray diffraction data alone.,contradiction
"The Raman spectra collected at room conditions after the high-pressure experiments show, unambiguously, that a residual fraction of methanol (and/or ethanol and probably even extra H2O) still resides into the zeolitic sub-nanocavities; these extra-molecules are spontaneously released into the atmosphere after a few days.",contradiction
"Overall, these experimental findings suggest that the amount of residual extra molecules incorporated into the cavities is not significant at the X-ray scale, but it is significant in Raman spectroscopy.",contradiction
This lead to consider that the P-induced crystal?fluid interaction phenomena are better described when complementary X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques are used.,contradiction

"As we shall see below, this estimation makes use of the equation of state of LiH determined by Loubeyre et al. [2] mentioned above, as well as of a model, termed cB? model (see below), which interconnects the defect Gibbs energy g i and the bulk elastic data [8?19].",contradiction
"Along these lines, we first summarize the cB? model in Section 2, and then we apply it to LiH in Section 3.",contradiction
"The so-called cB? model [9?19] states that the defect Gibbs energy g i is proportional to the isothermal bulk modulus B and the mean volume ? per atom, i.e.,(1)gi=ciB?where c i is a dimensionless constant practically independent of temperature (T) and pressure (P).",contradiction

The model has been checked for various defect processes in several categories of solids and has been found to agree with the experimental data (see Refs. [9?19]).,contradiction
"Among the applications of this model, we refer here to the most recent ones: first, Katsika-Tsigourakou and Vassilikou-Dova [20] by making use of the compressibility [21] of the defect volume [22?24] predicted by the cB? model, achieved in calculating the bulk modulus of a mixed alkali halide crystal in terms of the compressibility of the pure constituents.",contradiction
"Second, the same authors [25] relying on an interconnection between the ionic polarizability and the bulk modulus [26,27], recently showed [25] that the considerable temperature increase of the static dielectric constant can be accounted for.",contradiction
"By differentiating Eq. (1) with respect to pressure and considering that the defect volume ? i is given by ? i =(dg i/dP)|T we find(2)?i=cidBdP|T?1?which, when combined with Eq. (1), leads to(3)?i=giBdBdP|T?1This relation interconnects ? i and g i through the bulk properties B and (dB/dP)|T that are involved in the equation of state.",contradiction
Let us now apply Eq. (3) to the case of the Schottky pair formation volume ? f.,contradiction
"In order to do that, we first need to estimate g f, while only the formation enthalpy h f is experimentally available.",contradiction
"Thus, the value of the Schottky defect formation entropy s f is required.",contradiction
"This, from statistical thermodynamics [8], is a statistical measure accounting for the variation of the frequencies produced by the formation of one cation- and one anion-vacancy (and hence is different from the dynamic entropy [28] associated with the time evolution of complex systems [29?31]).",contradiction
Its value can be calculated from the relation s f =(?dg f/dT)|P considering that g f is given from Eq. (1) and that B and ? depend on temperature.,contradiction
"Following the procedure explained in Refs. [10,12,13] and taking into account the (thermal) volume expansion coefficient as well as the dB/dT value measured at T =300K by Gerlich and Smith [32], we find s f?10 k B (where k B is the usual Boltzmann constant) which is comparable to that found in alkali halides [8].",contradiction
"By inserting this value (and recalling that h f =2.33eV) into the well-known relation g f = h f ? Ts f, we find g f?2.07eV at T =300K.",contradiction
We now turn to the experimental determination of the equation of state by Loubeyre et al. [2].,contradiction
"Their P(V) data are reproduced very well by a form which depends on three parameters, the volume at ambient pressure, the isothermal bulk modulus B (=32.2GPa) and the pressure derivative dB/dP (=3.53).",entailment
The values obtained for these parameters are comparable to those estimated from the ultrasonic measurements [32] B =31.9GPa and (dB/dP)T =3.7 at T =300K.,entailment

"This clearly exceeds the molecular volume 10.25cm3/mol (considering the nearest cation?anion distance 2.0417A? given in Ref. [6]) which reflects the following [8]: the relaxation volume around the anion- and cation-vacancy is positive, i.e., the neighboring ions around the anion- and cation-vacancy are moving on the average outwards.",contradiction
"This is similar to the behavior observed [8,33] in alkali halides.",contradiction
We now proceed to the calculation of the volume ? m for the migration of the cation vacancy.,contradiction
"Following the same procedure as the one explained above for s f, the entropy s m for the cation vacancy migration is found to lie between 1 and 2 k B.",contradiction
"This, when recalling that the corresponding cation migration enthalpy is h m =0.54eV, and using the relation g m = h m ? Ts m, leads to g m =0.50eV.",contradiction
"Then Eq. (3), when considering the values of B and dB/dP from Ref. [2] mentioned in the previous paragraph, gives ? m =3.8cm3/mol.",contradiction
"This is smaller than the mean volume per atom, a behavior which is similar to the one found for the values of ? m/? resulted from the ionic conductivity measurements in alkali halides by Yoon and Lazarus [33].",contradiction
"In order to realize the extent of this similarity, we compile in Table 1 the results in NaCl along the present findings in LiH.",contradiction

"The calculation was made at T =300K, but we expect [8] that the values of ? f/2? and ? m/? at higher temperatures will probably be higher, because B should become smaller [32] and (dB/dP)T will probably increase [8,34].",contradiction

Bulk acoustic wave (BAW) properties of non-(002)-oriented AlN [1?3] and ZnO [4] thin films have been reported recently.,contradiction
It was pointed out that the (103)-oriented AlN thin films that can excite the fast quasi shear BAW mode (velocity=5957m/s; K2=3.8%) along c-axis exhibit a great potential for film bulk acoustic wave resonator (FBAR) liquid sensors.,contradiction
"In terms of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) properties, the electromechanical coupling constant of the (103) AlN thin films on the (100) Si substrate along a-axis is larger than (002) AlN thin films on (100) Si substrate [5].",contradiction
The (103) AlN thin films therefore becomes an attractive piezoelectric material for the applications in SAW and FBAR devices.,contradiction
"The AlN thin films can be deposited by several techniques including molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [6?8], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [9?11], pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [12?14], and reactive sputtering [15?17].",contradiction
Most of these techniques require a high substrate temperature.,contradiction
"However, deposition with a wide variety of substrate materials is possible at a low temperature (below 500øC), compatible with current semiconductor processes, through reactive sputtering.",contradiction
"It is also commonly known that although reactive sputtering forms polycrystalline thin films, properties of the high-quality AlN thin films thus sputtered are approximately identical to those of monocrystalline films.",contradiction
"Properties of AlN thin films depend strongly on sputtering conditions [18,19].",contradiction
"In this study, the (103) AlN thin films were deposited perpendicularly onto (100) Si substrates through radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering at 300øC with water-cooled Al target (purity 99.99%), 7.62cm in diameter, in a 50% N2/(N2 +Ar) gas mixture environment.",contradiction
The purity of N2 was 99.9995% while that of Ar was 99.99%.,contradiction

"Corresponding to the RF powers of 150, 250, and 350W, center line averages (R a) are 3.402, 2.941, and 1.208nm, respectively, while root-mean-square averages (RMS) are 4.259, 3.668, and 1.526nm, respectively.",contradiction
"Clearly, surface roughness of the (103) AlN thin film decreases as the RF power increases, and this implies that crystalline grains of the thin film become more uniform at a greater RF power.",contradiction
"Mechanical properties of the (103) AlN thin films deposited with different RF powers were measured using NanoXP© indenter (MTS Cooperation, Nano Instruments Innovation Center, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) with a diamond Berkovich indenter tip (tip radius ?50nm).",contradiction
"We followed the continuous contact stiffness measurement (CSM) procedure [21], which was accomplished by superimposing small oscillations at 45Hz on the force signal to measure displacement responses.",contradiction
The indenter was loaded and unload three times to ensure that the tip was in proper contact with the surface of the specimen.,contradiction
The indenter was then loaded with a strain rate of 0.05s?1.,contradiction
"Since the thickness of the deposited AlN thin film was around 1?1.5?m, the maximum indentation depth was set at 150nm to avoid the substrate effect [22,23].",contradiction

"Hardness and Young's moduli of the (103) AlN thin films deposited with different RF powers are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively, with respect to the indentation depth.",contradiction
"By averaging measurement data obtained over indentation depths ranging from 50 to 100nm, hardness of the (103) AlN thin films deposited with RF powers of 150, 250, and 350W is 14.92ñ0.93, 14.28ñ0.47, and 18.91ñ1.03GPa, respectively, while Young's moduli are 168.89ñ5.99, 162.59ñ6.84, and 242.26ñ8.92GPa, respectively.",contradiction
It is clear that the greatest hardness and Young's modulus of the (103) AlN thin film was achieved with the RF power at 350W.,contradiction

"Residual indentation depths are 64nm for 150W, 67nm for 250W, and 68nm for 350W, although these depths can only be considered as qualitative data because the NanoVision© system uses the same blunt Berkovich tip for probing, which is less sensitive than a sharp probing tip used in a conventional AFM.",contradiction
"Scratch tests were performed with the traverse movement of the Berkovitch indenter, pressed by a normal load of 10 or 30mN, on the surfaces of the (103) AlN thin films for about 200?m.",contradiction
The scratch rate was set at 1 or 10?m/s.,contradiction
At least 10 scratches per sample were conducted.,contradiction
"We computed the coefficient of friction (COF), defined by dividing the lateral force encountered during the scratch by the normal load [26].",contradiction
"Fig. 5 shows, for instance, COFs corresponding to a normal load of 10mN and a scratch rate of 1?m/s for (103) AlN thin films deposited with different RF powers.",contradiction
Table 1 summarizes COFs obtained from scratch tests with different normal loads and scratch rates.,contradiction
We note from the results that a greater normal load leads to a greater COF while the scratch rates of 1 and 10?m/s do not seem to cause a difference on the COF.,contradiction
"Furthermore, though COFs of (103) AlN thin films appear to be similar regardless of the RF powers, their experimental variation is the least for the thin film deposited with 350W.",contradiction
"This is coincident with the surface roughness examination presented in the previous section, for which the (103) AlN thin film deposited with an RF power of 350W exhibits the most compact surface condition.",contradiction
"We investigate in this work structural and mechanical characteristics of (103) AlN thin films deposited onto (100) Si substrates with radio frequency magnetron sputtering at 150, 250, and 350W.",contradiction

"Furthermore, the (103) AlN thin film deposited with an RF power of 350W exhibits the most compact surface condition with the least surface roughness and COF variation.",contradiction
Heat release as well as the changes of the elastic moduli upon crystallization were reliably noticed already in the first studies of metallic glasses [1?4].,contradiction
"Since then, thousands of papers addressing these basic behaviors have been published.",contradiction
"However, the underlying physical reasons leading to these effects still constitute a matter for discussions.",contradiction
The crystallization heat release is qualitatively interpreted as a consequence of the non-crystallinity of glass and related additional structural energy while lowered elastic constants of metallic glasses are qualitatively discussed using different approaches [5?7].,contradiction
Such a situation originates from the insufficient understanding of the nature of metallic glass structure and microscopic mechanisms responsible for its physical properties.,contradiction
"As a matter of fact, any verified and commonly accepted theory describing the basic structural aspects of metallic glasses is hitherto absent.",contradiction
"An interesting and versatile approach to this issue is provided by the interstitialcy theory of condensed matter (ITCM) states proposed by Granato [8,9].",contradiction
"The ITCM provides a generic relationship between the maternal crystal, equilibrium/supercooled liquid and glass.",contradiction
"It starts with the assumption that melting of simple metals occurs due to the rapid increase of the concentration of interstitial atoms in the dumbbell (split) configuration [8,10].",contradiction
"In the liquid state, the large defect concentration provides both very low (but non-zero) shear modulus and related fluidity.",contradiction
Rapid melt quenching results in partial freezing of the defects in the solid glass while structural relaxation of the latter is determined by a change of the defect concentration.,contradiction
"This scheme provides quantitative explanations for quite a few important phenomena related to the glassy and liquid states as well as their relationship with the maternal crystal (for a review, see Refs. [9?12] and papers cited therein).",contradiction
"In the recent paper [13], we suggested a new approach, which is closely related to the ITCM.",contradiction
"As is known, the interstitial dumbbell configuration represents a particular case of an ?elastic dipole?, which is by definition an atomic configuration with the local symmetry lower than that of the surrounding matrix structure [14] and, therefore, can be identified in a macroscopically isotropic material.",contradiction
"The assumption on the presence of such ?defects? in glass makes it possible to derive relatively simple expressions, for instance, for the internal energy and elastic characteristics.",contradiction
"On the basis of this assumption, we performed calculations [13] showing a direct connection between the change of the shear modulus of glass and heat effects occurring upon structural relaxation of glass below the crystallization onset temperature T c.",contradiction
Specially performed experiments revealed a good agreement with these calculations [13].,contradiction
"In this work, we present similar calculations of the changes of the internal energy and elastic moduli occurring upon crystallization of metallic glasses.",contradiction
We performed a check of the derived relationship between the heat effect and change of the elastic properties upon crystallization using available experimental data on bulk Zr52.5Ti5Cu17.9Ni14.6Al10 metallic glass.,contradiction
"Let us consider the basic relations, which connect the characteristics of frozen-in elastic dipoles with the physical properties of metallic glasses.",contradiction
The presence of elastic dipoles in glass creates internal elastic strains ? ij.,contradiction
"As a first approximation, we assume that the difference between the internal energy of glass and that of the reference crystal, which defines the heat release upon full crystallization, is determined by the elastic energy associated with these elastic dipoles.",contradiction
This assumption is supported by the recent computer simulation [15] showing that the insertion of dumbbell intertitials in copper eventually leads to the transformation of the partial distribution function from crystalline to typically non-crystalline pattern.,contradiction
"Following Ref. [13], the internal energy U per unit mass of an isotropic glass in the presence of internal strains created by elastic dipoles can be written down as a non-linear expansion in terms of the invariants of the internal strain tensor,(1)?0U=?0U0+12?I12+?I2+16?1I13+?2I1I2+43?3I3+124?1I14+12?2I12I2+43?3I1I3+12?4I22+...,where ? 0 is the density, U 0 is the internal energy per unit mass of the undeformed state, I 1 = ? ii, I 2 = ? ij ? ji and I 3 = ? ij ? jk ? ik are the algebraical invariants of the deformation tensor ? ij, ? and ? are the second-order Lame? elastic constants, ? 1, ? 2 and ? 3 are the third-order Lame? elastic constants, and ? 1, ? 2, ? 3 and ? 4 are the fourth-order Lame? elastic constants.",contradiction
"The elastic constants of interest can be accepted as [16]: the shear modulus G=?04?2U??122 and the longitudinal modulus CL=?0?2U??112, where ? 12 and ? 11 are the corresponding components of the strain tensor ? ij.",contradiction
"We showed earlier [12,13] that the dilatation (volume change ?V/V induced by frozen-in elastic dipoles) makes an insignificant contribution to the change of the internal energy and shear modulus at temperatures T < T c (we show below that this statement is also valid at temperatures above T c).",contradiction
"In this case (i.e. provided that ?V/V =0), considering only the first terms of the corresponding expansions, the expressions for the elastic moduli become:(2)G=?+?4?tI2, (3)CL=?+2?+?2+43?3+2?4?lI2,where ?t ?1.38 and ?l ?1.54 are the averaged dipole form factors for the shear and longitudinal deformations, respectively (see Ref. [13] for details).",contradiction
"Under the same assumption of zero dilatation, a good approximation for the internal energy change is [13] (4)?0U??0U0=?0?U=?I2.",contradiction
"Since an elastic dipole interacts with the external tensor stress, it can be characterized by a second-rank tensor ? ij with the components equal to the components of the deformation tensor per unit concentration c of elastic dipoles, ?ij=???ij0dVV?c, where ? ij 0 is the strain field created by unidirectional elastic dipoles [13,14].",contradiction
"Analogously, one can define the quadratic and cubic forms of the dipole deformation tensor [13], so that, for instance, ?ij?kl=???ij0?kl0dVV?c.",contradiction
"Then, using Eqs. (2)?(4), one can write down the following relations for the change of the internal energy and elastic moduli,(5)?0?U=?c?ij?ji ?, (6)G=?+?4?tc?ij?ji ?, (7)CL=?+2?+?2+43?3+2?4?lc?ij?ji ?.",contradiction
The bars in Eqs. (5) to (7) denote averaging over all elastic dipoles.,contradiction
"These equations show that the changes of the internal energy and elastic moduli with respect to the reference crystal are conditioned by the averaged quadratic form of the dipole ?-tensor and concentration c of frozen-in elastic dipoles (if c =0, then ?U =0 and the elastic moduli are equal to those of the reference crystal), i.e. by the quantity c?ij?ji ?.",contradiction
"Here, ? ij ? ji is an analogue of the second-order invariant of the strain caused by a dipole.",contradiction
Another important point is that the decrease of the shear and longitudinal moduli with respect to the reference crystalline state is conditioned by the fourth-order Lame? elastic constants.,contradiction
"In other words, the softening of glass is clearly determined by the anharmonic effects [13].",contradiction
"Although the volume change ?VV, as mentioned earlier [12,13], actually does not exert any important effect on the internal energy and elastic properties, this quantity can be useful for an estimate of the concentration of frozen-in elastic dipoles.",contradiction
"Indeed, if the elastic dipoles are in fact dumbbell interstitials, then the volume change associated with them is(8)?VV=?i?1c,where ? i is the so-called relaxation volume (see Ref. [12] for details).",contradiction
"Then, using Eq. (5), one can estimate the dipole formation energy,(9)Ud=m??0NA?Uc=?m??0NA?ij?ji ?,with m ? being the molar mass and N A the Avogadro number.",contradiction
The verification of the above equations was performed on bulk glassy Zr52.5Ti5Cu17.9Ni14.6Al10 (at.%).,contradiction
"The choice is simply conditioned by the fact that this is so far the only metallic glass (at least, to our knowledge) with the known [17] fourth-order Lame? elastic constants, which, according to Eqs. (6) and (7), determine the elastic softening of glass.",contradiction
"Since the elastic moduli in the as-quenched state could be notably dependent on the quenching conditions [18], for the verification we used the elastic constants determined for the relaxed glass.",contradiction
Measurements of the sound velocities were performed by the pulse-echo method at a frequency of 5MHz using the transmission mode [19].,contradiction
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a Hitachi Exstar DSC7020 instrument in flowing Ar atmosphere.,contradiction
"For relaxed glassy samples obtained by slow cooling from T > T g (T g is the glass transition temperature), the sound velocities were found equal to V t =(2.29ñ0.01)ž103 m/s and V l =(5.07ñ0.03)ž103 m/s.",contradiction
"For measurements of the sound velocities in the crystalline state, we used two types of samples, i.e. initially amorphous samples crystallized at 998K and crystalline samples obtained by slow cooling of the melt.",contradiction
"In both types of samples, the corresponding sound velocities were found to be same within the measurement error and equal to V t =(2.55ñ0.02)ž103 m/s and V l =(5.26ñ0.05)ž103 m/s.",contradiction
"Taking into account that the density upon crystallization of the glass under investigation increases by ?2% (Ref. [20]), the differences between the shear and longitudinal moduli in the crystalline and relaxed amorphous states are ?G =(9.3ñ0.3)GPa and ?C L =(16.9ñ3.5)GPa, respectively.",contradiction
"Thus, the ratio ?CL?G=1.8ñ0.4. The values of the fourth-rank elastic moduli for the same glass are equal to ? 2 =(?373ñ100)GPa, ? 3 =(390ñ35)GPa and ? 4 =(?171ñ12)GPa (Ref. [17]).",entailment
"Using these data, the ratio ?CL?G=?2+43?3+2?lž?l?4?1 becomes equal to 1.6ñ0.5. It is seen that within the error, the theoretical value of this ratio coincides with the experimental one, supporting thus the notions under consideration.",contradiction
"At the present time, it is not possible to verify the ratio ?CL?G for other metallic glasses.",contradiction
"To our knowledge, one can find the experimental data on this ratio only in two papers [21,22].",contradiction
"In these papers, ?CL?G-values were found to be 1.5 and 2.7 for the compositions Pd39Ni10Cu30P21 and Zr48Nb8Cu14Ni12Be18, respectively.",contradiction
These values differ from the ?CL?G=1.8 derived above.,contradiction
"For the theoretical estimate of this quantity, one needs to know the fourth-order elastic moduli ? 2, ? 3 and ? 4, which are so far known only for the only composition studied in the present paper.",contradiction
The heat of crystallization was calculated using the DSC data.,contradiction
DSC measurements were performed using the following scheme.,contradiction
The first run consisted in measurement of the heat flow W gl(T) of the initial glassy sample up to T f =998K.,contradiction
"Then, the second run up the same final temperature was performed on the same sample and the heat flow W cr(T) for the crystallized sample was obtained.",contradiction
"These data were used to calculate the differential heat flow W d(T)= W gl ? W cr, which was further used to calculate the integral crystallization heat,(10)QT=1T ??TRTTWdTdT,with T RT and T? being the room temperature and heating rate, respectively.",contradiction
"An example of the obtained W d(T)- and Q(T)-data is shown in Fig. 1 , which gives a pattern typical of metallic glasses.",contradiction
"To verify these data, we performed the third measurement cycle, which showed the absence of additional heat effects compared with the second measurement run.",contradiction
"To estimate the crystallization heat of the relaxed sample, we calculated the difference between the full heat effect (i.e. determined using Eq. (10) with T = T f as the upper integration limit) and the heat effect reached upon heating the initial sample up to T g ?643K (i.e. calculated with Eq. (10) using T = T g as the upper integration limit).",contradiction
Additional measurements performed on the relaxed samples confirmed that the integral heat is decreased by about this difference compared to the unrelaxed samples.,contradiction
"Thus, the crystallization heat of the relaxed glass was estimated to be Q c =(190ñ35)J/g that corresponds to 14ñ2.5kJ/mol.",contradiction
Let us now consider whether it is correct to neglect the volume change in the above consideration.,contradiction
"In the presence of the dilatation, the main additional contribution to the internal energy is defined by the term 12?+23??V/V2.",contradiction
"The magnitude of this contribution can be easily estimated as ?7.5J/g, which is less than the experimental crystallization heat Q c by more than an order of magnitude.",contradiction
"If one considers the elastic moduli, e.g. the shear modulus, then the most significant contribution into their change is connected with the terms linear in the dilatation [13,17].",contradiction
"Since the elastic moduli are determined from the measurements of the sound velocity, the magnitude of the effect is connected not only with the physical non-linearity (for the shear modulus, for instance, with the term ?2+43?3?V/V) but with the geometrical non-linearity [16] as well.",contradiction
"One should also take into account the method, which is used to derive the shear modulus change from acoustic measurements.",contradiction
"Upon in situ measurements, the magnitude of the relative change of the shear modulus is determined using the change of sample's resonant frequency, f = v/2L, or the propagation time, ? = L/v with L being the sample's dimension.",contradiction
"In this case, the additional contribution into the shear modulus change connected with the dilatation is ?+43?+?2+43?3?V/V.",contradiction
"In the present case, we measured the absolute quantity ?v 2, which leads to the additional dilatation-induced contribution to the shear modulus change equal to ?+?+?2+43?3?V/V.",contradiction
"The estimate of this quantity using the third-order shear moduli determined in Ref. [17] gives ??0.7GPa, which is also an order of magnitude smaller than the shear modulus change upon crystallization.",contradiction
"For the longitudinal modulus, a similar relation can be derived.",contradiction
"One has to conclude, therefore, that the disregard of the dilatational contribution upon calculating the internal energy and elastic moduli is quite justified, in line with earlier consideration [13].",contradiction
"In connection with the calculation given above, the following has to be pointed out.",contradiction
"To determine the crystallization heat release, one usually takes into account only the heat associated with the first (or first and second) crystallization DSC peaks.",contradiction
"Fig. 1 demonstrates, however, that besides the first two pronounced crystallization peaks (located at 720K and 728K at T? =5K/min) one obtains much smaller peaks located at about 800K, 873K and 952K.",contradiction
"If the purpose is to estimate the whole change of the internal energy associated with elastic dipoles, one should take into account that the dissipation of this energy, except of the annihilation of dipoles with vacancies and disappearance on the surfaces, may occur stepwise via several other ways.",contradiction
"For instance, the dipoles can merge into clusters [23] leading to a decrease of the energy (per defect), which, however, still remains big enough.",contradiction
The clusters might serve as a source of nanoscale metastable phases occurring upon crystallization of glass.,contradiction
"Besides that, the relaxation of the dipole system might lead to the formation of dislocation loops [24], which, in turn, may be important upon formation of grain boundaries.",contradiction
"Thus, to fully estimate the energy related to the elastic dipoles, one should accept the reference crystalline structure with large grains containing no metastable phases, i.e. the structure, which is stable at temperatures not far away from the melting temperature and which is the source of the liquid state occurring upon melting.",contradiction
It is the reason why we try to take into account the whole heat effect observed upon heating of glass to high temperatures.,contradiction
"Using Eqs. (5) and (6) together with the experimental data on the crystallization heat and shear modulus change upon crystallization, one can estimate the fourth-rank elastic modulus ?4=?GQc?=?220ñ40 GPa.",contradiction
"This reasonably agrees with ? 4 =?(171ñ12)GPa obtained experimentally in Ref. [17], especially taking into account that only the first expansion terms were used to derive these equations.",contradiction
The averaged dipole energy can be calculated using Eq. (9) as(11)Ud=m?NAQc?i?1?V/V.,contradiction
"Taking the crystallization-induced dilatation of the glass under investigation as given above and assuming the characteristic relaxation volume ? i for a dumbbell interstitial equal to 1.55 (Ref. [12]) (the dipole concentration calculated with this ? i using Eq. (11) is about 3.7%) then with Eq. (11) one arrives at U d ?3.9eV, which is in general agreement with typical dumbbell interstitial formation energies in simple metals [25].",contradiction
"Accepting the same dipole concentration and using Eqs. (5) and (6), one can estimate the average quantity ?ij?ji ?=0.92ñ0.12.",contradiction
This value belongs to a typical range for the known types of elastic dipoles in crystals [14].,contradiction
"Thus, the obtained data indicate that the interpretation of the shear softening and crystallization heat from the viewpoint of the presence of elastic dipoles in glassy structure leads to self-consistent results.",contradiction
"However, this conclusion has to be further verified on other metallic glass systems.",contradiction
The elastic softening of metallic glasses can be understood as a result of the presence of their main structural ?defects? ? elastic dipoles ? frozen-in from the melt upon glass formation.,contradiction
"Crystallization leads to the dissipation of the elastic energy associated with these dipoles, which is experimentally detected as the heat release.",contradiction
"Using a non-linear representation of the internal energy associated with dipoles suggested earlier [13], we calculated the heat release and changes of the elastic moduli occurring upon crystallization.",contradiction
"It has been found that the calculated quantities are quite consistent with the experimental data, supporting thus the concept under consideration.",contradiction
"Moreover, we found that the characteristic ?-tensor of elastic dipoles and their formation energy in glass are quite close to the corresponding quantities for elastic dipoles in simple crystalline metals.",contradiction
We also determined that the dilatation associated with frozen-in elastic dipoles is insignificant and can be neglected.,contradiction

"Single crystals of specific polymorphic form were prepared according to literature data with certain modifications (Caira et al., 2003; Hassan et al., 1997; Hegedus, 2001; Lu et al., 2007; Overgaard and Hibbs, 2004; Reutzel-Edens et al., 2003; Vrec?er et al., 2003).",contradiction
"For single-crystal characterization and identification, single-crystal X-ray diffractometry was used.",contradiction
Crystalline powders used for tableting were examined by DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) in order to confirm the presence of specific polymorphic forms.,contradiction
"Compactibility of pharmaceutical powders is mainly governed by the dominant bond mechanism (intermolecular forces, solid bridges, mechanical interlocking) and the surface area over which these bonds are active.",contradiction
"According to Nystrom et al., intermolecular forces constitute the dominant bond mechanism for pharmaceutical materials (Nystrom et al., 1993).",contradiction
"Because intermolecular forces (van der Waals force, electrostatic force, and hydrogen bonds) are weak interactions, the surface area (more interactions can be formed) might have a significant effect on the mechanical strength of compacts (Sonnergaard, 2006).",contradiction
Polymorphs make it possible to explore and understand the impact of different crystal packaging on their compactibility properties.,contradiction
"In analyzing the crystal structures of both famotidine polymorphs, a noticeable difference in molecular packing was observed.",contradiction
"Famotidine A possesses one intramolecular hydrogen bond, whereas two intramolecular hydrogen bonds were observed in famotidine B.",contradiction
"This causes famotidine B to exist in a kind of ?folded? conformation and form A is in a more ?extended? conformation (Overgaard and Hibbs, 2004).",contradiction
"As a consequence, different packing schemes were observed.",contradiction
Molecules of form A are densely packed in a three-dimensional network.,contradiction
The molecules are highly cross-linked through hydrogen bonds.,contradiction
"On the other hand, different packing arrangements of molecules are observed in famotidine B.",contradiction
Molecules are connected through hydrogen bonds to form layers that represent a slip system.,contradiction
"Based on crystal structure and closer packing, the more stable form A is expected to have higher true density, which was confirmed by our measurements (Table 7 ).",contradiction
"According to Summers et al. (1977) who conducted the experiment on sulfathiazole and barbital, the more stable polymorphs (due to their higher packing density) are expected to form stronger interparticulate bonds.",contradiction
"Therefore, according to Summers? density rule a higher bonding strength of form A over form B would be expected.",contradiction
"In our study, the opposite observation was revealed.",contradiction
This can mainly be attributed to the higher plasticity of form B because the presence of a slip plane was determined in famotidine B.,contradiction
"Plastic deformation causes a permanent change in the particle shape, which increases the interparticulate contact area and promotes binding (Bandyopadhyay and Grant, 2002; Sonnergaard, 2006).",contradiction
"Thus, more contact points can be formed in compacts of the more plastically deformable famotidine B, which resulted in higher compactibility despite the higher true density of famotidine A.",contradiction
"Several authors established that the increase in bonding surface area resulting from particle deformation and/or fragmentation has a higher impact on tablet strength than the interparticle bond strength of molecules alone (Singhal and Curatolo, 2004; Sheth and Grant, 2005; Sun and Grant, 2001).",contradiction
"Roberts and Rowe also reported that the most stable form of the polymorphs of carbamazepine, sulfathiazole, and sulfanilamide had a higher Young?s modulus, yield stress, and true density, and were less compressible and compactible: a longer dwell time was needed to allow sufficient plastic flow and bond formation to occur (Roberts et al., 1995).",contradiction
"To support the claim that compactibility is mainly governed by plastic deformational characteristics, plasticity parameters determined at the single-crystal and bulk level were related to compactibility coefficients.",contradiction
"Good correlations were observed between Cp and H (Fig. 8 , R2 =0.92), and Cp versus w?out-die (Fig. 9 , R2 =0.92), but the correlation between Cp and K out-die (R2 =0.63) was poorer.",contradiction
Our experiment indicates that the compactibility of the APIs examined is significantly influenced by the materials? deformational properties because good correlations were found among plasticity parameters at the single-crystal (H) and bulk level (w?out-die) with compactibility coefficients (Cp ).,contradiction
The fact that a material?s mechanical properties determined at single-crystal level to a great extent determine its compaction properties can be exploited in preformulation studies.,contradiction
"In this way, different polymorphs can be mapped and the one with the preferred mechanical properties can be chosen.",contradiction
"In addition, if poor mechanical properties of an API were determined, the excipients that would mask these poor properties could be better selected.",contradiction
Thus better manufacturing control could be established.,contradiction
"All processes and properties can be better understood when looking at them on a smaller scale; that is, the particulate and molecular level (Dowling, 1993).",contradiction
Instrumented nanoindentation is used to reveal the deformational properties on a smaller scale.,contradiction
Deformational properties at the single-crystal level can be assessed using Young?s modulus (E) and indentation hardness (H).,contradiction
E is a measure of material?s stiffness; a higher value means that the material is stiffer and less elastically deformable.,contradiction

"Instrumented nanoindentation revealed similar mechanical properties for famotidine A, nifedipine ?, olanzapine I, and piroxicam I at all crystal faces.",contradiction
"This is accordance with highly cross-linked molecular packaging in all directions for the APIs investigated (Bhardwaj et al., 2013; Gunn et al., 2012; Kojic?-Prodic? and Ruz?ic?-Toros?, 1982; Naelapaa et al., 2012; Overgaard and Hibbs, 2004; Reutzel-Edens et al., 2003).",contradiction
"The E results for famotidine A and B indicate that they were the stiffest materials, whereas other crystalline APIs had comparable E values.",contradiction
"Plasticity described with H was comparable for nifedipine ? and piroxicam I, which are the most plastically deformable among the APIs tested.",contradiction
"The comparison of the mechanical properties between famotidine A and B revealed that famotidine B is much more plastic but they have similar elasticity, and thus form B has more favorable properties for tableting.",contradiction
The difference in plasticity of polymorphic forms of famotidine can be further explained by analyzing their crystal structures.,contradiction
"Famotidine A and B have different molecular packaging (Overgaard and Hibbs, 2004).",contradiction
Molecules of form A are highly cross-linked through hydrogen bonds and packed in a three-dimensional network.,contradiction
Intermolecular interactions can be considered similar in all directions and thus form A possesses isotropic behavior.,contradiction
"On the other hand, molecules in famotidine B are connected through hydrogen bonds to form layers that represent a slip system (associated with increased plastic deformation).",contradiction
Anisotropy of famotidine B can be considered as reasonable due to layered organization of the molecules and determined slip planes.,contradiction
"Because of demanding crystal shape of famotidine B (thin plate-like), orientation and positioning of the crystal was possible just in the way of indentation in normal direction to slip planes (<101>).",contradiction
"The lower plasticity and higher stiffness of form A is assumed to be influenced by intermolecular hydrogen bonds rather than intramolecular ones, which reduces the flexibility of the form.",contradiction
"Comparing both famotidine polymorphs, the higher plasticity of form B was also confirmed at the bulk level with the Walker and Heckel coefficients.",contradiction
"The elastic component of deformation is more pronounced in the case of piroxicam I, nifedipine ?, famotidine B, and olanzapine I, which was also confirmed at the bulk level with ER.",contradiction
"In addition, the H/Py parameter at the single-crystal level was determined.",contradiction
"According to Roberts and Rowe, the material is considered brittle when the ratio is 2.0?2.2, whereas above 2.2 there is a tendency towards reduction in brittle behavior, and >3.0 the material is considered a rigid, plastic solid (Roberts and Rowe, 1987).",contradiction
"In our study, the ratio for the APIs investigated was mostly around 2.4 or 2.5 except for famotidine A, for which a value of 2.1 was determined.",contradiction
"Therefore the APIs investigated at the single-crystal level expressed mainly brittle behavior, most markedly in famotidine A.",contradiction
Whether single-crystal deformational properties can be used to predict bulk deformational characteristics was assessed by correlating single and bulk elasticity and plasticity parameters.,contradiction
"Therefore, the Walker and Heckel coefficients, both expressing bulk plastic deformation, were compared to indentation hardness at the single-crystal level.",contradiction
The results showed a good correlation (R2 =0.85) between the out-die Walker coefficient and indentation hardness as seen in Fig. 6 .,contradiction
"According to these results, the Walker model describes plastic deformation of the APIs investigated better than the Heckel model.",contradiction
"The better discriminative power of the Walker model to differentiate among deformational properties of different materials has already been reported (Govedarica et al., 2012; Hassanpour and Ghadiri, 2004; Ilic? et al., 2013; Sonnergaard, 1999).",contradiction
Correlation between elastic properties at the single-crystal and bulk level was further explored.,contradiction
A good correlation (R2 =0.93) was obtained between the compliance parameter (1/E) and ER (elastic relaxation index; Fig. 7 ).,contradiction
Good correlations between deformational parameters determined at the single-crystal level and bulk level were obtained for the APIs studied.,contradiction
"This led to the conclusion that, when molecules in crystals are highly cross-linked through hydrogen bonds exhibiting mechanically interlocked structures with similar interactions in all directions, as in the APIs studied, deformational characteristics determined at the single-crystal level can be used as a good indicator of bulk deformational properties.",contradiction
Different APIs could be successfully differentiated with respect to their mechanical properties and their ability to form compacts.,contradiction
"The preferred compaction properties of the APIs tested were assessed for nifedipine ?, whereas piroxicam I had the poorest.",contradiction
"Comparing two famotidine polymorphic forms, a distinct difference in plasticity parameters was noticed.",contradiction
"The difference in plasticity of both forms was also consistent with the difference in their crystal packaging ? in particular, the presence of slip planes in famotidine B.",contradiction
An excellent relationship was established for the APIs investigated between single-crystal and bulk level elastic (compliance versus elastic relaxation index) and plastic (indentation hardness versus out-die Walker coefficient) parameters.,contradiction
The Walker model showed more practical value for evaluating bulk mechanical properties because the deformational properties of the APIs investigated were distinctly categorized in comparison to Heckel.,contradiction
"For the APIs studied, it was shown that plasticity parameters determined at the single and bulk level to a great extent define the material propensity to form compacts.",contradiction
Good correlations were obtained between indentation hardness versus compactibility coefficient and between out-die Walker coefficient versus compactibility coefficient.,contradiction
The main conclusion drawn from our study suggests that materials' innate mechanical properties determined at the single-crystal level seem to have an overwhelming effect on manufacturing of tablets considering compressibility and compactibility as well.,contradiction
"From the practical point of view, knowledge of the mechanical attributes of single crystals could help in choosing the preferred API polymorph and excipients early in the development phase with the intent of avoiding defects associated with tableting at later stages during production.",contradiction

"The second change of the elastic behavior could be also triggered by the coordination environment of the extraframework cations: the saturation of the NA?O2 and NA?O3 bond length trend (Fig. 6; Table 5) and of CA?O1, CA?O2 and CA?O3 trends with P (Table 5) suggest a change of the configuration of the extraframework polyhedra at P >3GPa.",contradiction

"From Table 2 it is seen that PBEsol, SOGGA, and WC perform quite similarly, with SOGGA on average giving slightly higher values than PBEsol and WC.",contradiction
This indicates that the obtained results are reliable and could be useful for various practical applications.,contradiction

"Although cubic phase exhibits the highest incompressibility of all under the uniaxial strains with C11Cub.=C22Cub.=C33Cub.?409 GPa, its resistance against shear deformations is reduced to C44Cub.=C55Cub.=C66Cub.?104 GPa.",contradiction
A similar value is demonstrated by rhombohedral structure for shear deformations around the x and y axes C44Rhomb.=C55Rhomb.?100GPa and by monoclinic phase for shear deformation around the z axis C66Mon.?106GPa.,contradiction
"But despite that, the latter is much easier to deform around the x axis with C44Mon.?46 GPa, whereas the former ? around the z axis with C66Rhomb.?52 GPa.",contradiction
"Some of the elastic constants, such as C15Mon.",contradiction
"or C35Mon., are negative and this may imply that monoclinic phase of LaNiO3 could be mechanically unstable.",contradiction
"However, this is not the case, since the stability restrictions on Cij, following from the requirement that the strain energy must always be positive for all applied strains, are fully satisfied.",contradiction
"It indicates that cubic, rhombohedral, and monoclinic structures of LaNiO3 are mechanically stable at zero temperature and zero pressure conditions.",contradiction
"The appropriate stability criteria on Cij for different phases of material can be found elsewhere [44,45].",contradiction
The knowledge of single-crystal elastic constants Cij allows one to evaluate mechanical and other important properties of polycrystals.,contradiction
The list of the parameters which describe the polycrystalline behavior of LaNiO3 is given in Table 3 .,contradiction
"For the sake of convenience, Table 3 presents values of bulk and shear moduli obtained by applying not only the averaging method recommended by Hill (B,G), but also the initial isostrain and isostress approximations correspondingly suggested by Voigt (BV,GV) and Reuss (BR,GR).",contradiction
It is worth to note a very good agreement between the bulk modulus B and the one evaluated from the BM equation of state BBM indicating a high numerical accuracy of our calculations.,contradiction
"Regarding the available experimental data, a value of BExpt.Rhomb.?188 GPa from the room-temperature measurements [46] nicely corresponds to BRhomb.?200 GPa, especially if one would take into consideration thermal effects which tend to reduce the elastic moduli.",contradiction
A comparison between the different phases of LaNiO3 in Table 3 reveals that all three structures exhibit a similar level of compressibility because the difference in their bulk moduli B does not exceed ?8%.,contradiction
"However, the cubic structure is more resistive to shear and uniaxial deformations: GCub.?119 GPa against GRhomb.?73 GPa and GMon.?74 GPa, and ECub.?301 GPa against ERhomb.?194 GPa and EMon.?197 GPa.",contradiction
This fact is also reflected in the lower value of Poisson?s ratio and higher values of sound velocities and Debye temperature compared to the rhombohedral and monoclinic phases.,contradiction
"The available experimental data for Debye temperature ?DExpt.=420 K [47] indicate a fairly good agreement with calculations ?DRhomb.?472 K, since the deviation from experiment does not exceed ?13%.",contradiction
"Further analysis of elastic parameters shows that the Vickers hardness for cubic LaNiO3 is more than two times larger in comparison to the rhombohedral and monoclinic LaNiO3: HVCub.?13.7 GPa against HVRhomb.?6.1 GPa and HVMon.?6.2 GPa, respectively.",contradiction
"This well-known mechanical property, defined as the ability of a material to resist against being dented or scratched by another, was obtained according to the expression HV=0.92(G/B)1.137G0.708 recently proposed by Tian et al. [48].",contradiction
"Interestingly, the apparent distinction in hardness does not change the ductile nature of cubic, rhombohedral, and monoclinic LaNiO3, although the latter two structures demonstrate a more pronounced ductility with corresponding B/G ratios of ?2.75 and ?2.71 compared to ?1.82 of the cubic phase.",contradiction
"The most common critical value that separates ductile and brittle character was introduced by Pugh [49]: if B/G>1.75, the material behaves in a ductile manner, otherwise, its behavior should be related with brittleness.",contradiction
"Elastic anisotropy can have considerable effects on durability of the material through the formation of microcracks, therefore this parameter plays an important practical role not less than the others.",contradiction
"The percentage anisotropy in compressibility and shear for polycrystals, originally suggested by Chung and Buessem [50], is defined as AB=100(BV-BR)/(BV+BR) and AG=100(GV-GR)/(GV+GR), respectively.",contradiction
"Here, a value of zero represents elastic isotropy, while a value of 100% identifies the largest possible anisotropy.",contradiction
"From Table 3 it is seen that rhombohedral and monoclinic phases of LaNiO3 exhibit a similarly weak anisotropy in compressibility with ABRhomb.?0.46% and ABMon.?0.5%, but their anisotropy in shear appears to be more pronounced, as the numbers accordingly increase up to AGRhomb.?7.14% and AGMon.?6.43%.",contradiction
"In the meantime, the perfect isotropy in compressibility for the cubic phase accompanied by its relatively weak anisotropy in shear AGCub.?1.26% speaks for the highest degree of elastic isotropy among the considered structures of LaNiO3.",contradiction
"And indeed, the following finding is confirmed by the universal anisotropy index AU=5(GV/GR)-(BV/BR)-6 [51], the values of which can also be found in Table 3.",contradiction
"By taking into account both the bulk and the shear contributions, AU represents a universal measure to quantify the single-crystal elastic anisotropy.",contradiction
"For an isotropic crystal, AU=0 and deviations from zero determine the extent of elastic anisotropy.",contradiction
"Gladly, the comparison of calculated values ACub.U?0.13,ARhomb.U?0.78, and AMon.U?0.7 shows a full compatibility with our previous observations drawn from AB and AG.",contradiction
"In general, one can notice that polycrystalline parameters derived for rhombohedral and monoclinic phases of LaNiO3 bear a very close resemblance to each other, since in most cases the discrepancy does not exceed ?10%.",contradiction
"On one hand, it implies that transformation of rhombohedral LaNiO3 into monoclinically distorted structure induced by compressive or tensile strains does not have a strong influence on its mechanical behavior.",contradiction
"But on the other hand, one should take into consideration that here we are dealing with a fully relaxed monoclinic system which is slightly different from non-relaxed ones experimentally identified on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates [16].",contradiction
"This difference is more strongly pronounced compared to rhombohedral geometry, as MARE of lattice constants, monoclinic angle, and volume for, e.g., PBEsol functional, reaches 0.83% under compressive and 2.04% under tensile strains, while analogous MARE in rhombohedral case does not exceed 0.21%.",contradiction
"However, we believe that our elastic parameters pretty reliably describe monoclinic LaNiO3 as long as the thickness of the film is sufficiently large to prevent from the occurrence of metal-to-insulator transition.",contradiction
Experimental investigation of electrical resistivity [52] and electronic structure [53] has revealed that films that are thick enough (10nm or somewhat less depending on the substrate) show clearly pronounced metallic behavior that is typical for bulk LaNiO3 and can be properly represented at DFT level.,contradiction
"But for the ultrathin LaNiO3 films composed of only several monolayers, a metal-to-insulator transition is observed and a standard DFT scheme fails to reproduce it [53].",contradiction
"Thus, in order to accurately describe the elastic properties of ultrathin LaNiO3 structures, one should apply more sophisticated theoretical methods.",contradiction
"In other cases, our given data seem to be sufficient.",contradiction
"Since many specific material properties like elastic constants, sound velocities, and Debye temperature are critically dependent on change in geometry of the system, we primarily concentrate on the accuracy of the calculated lattice constants and other structural parameters that are shown in Fig. 1 .",contradiction
The obtained values together with low-temperature experimental data for rhombohedral LaNiO3 are presented in Table 1 .,contradiction
"The mean absolute relative error (MARE) was evaluated according to the expression(1)MARE=100n?i=1npiCalc.-piExpt.piExpt.,in which piCalc.",contradiction
and piExpt.,contradiction
"are the calculated and experimental values of the considered parameter, respectively.",contradiction
Note that we did not apply the zero-point anharmonic expansion (ZPAE) corrections for the experimental data.,contradiction
"On one hand, the ZPAE corrections are straightforwardly applicable only for the cubic systems [41].",contradiction
"On the other hand, ZPAE can expand the equilibrium lattice constant by 1% for light atoms like Li and much less for heavy atoms [42], thus it should not have a noticeable influence on material like LaNiO3.",contradiction
"What is more, due to the corresponding thermal expansion and internal strains of the experimentally observed cubic and monoclinic phases of LaNiO3, we pay less attention to the geometry analysis of these two systems, since here they are modelled by fully-relaxed zero-temperature calculations.",contradiction
"However, for the sake of completeness, we have visualized the crystalline structures of all three phases of LaNiO3 (see Fig. 2 ) and made some important comments on the structural parameters of cubic and monoclinic geometries.",contradiction
"As it could be expected, Table 1 reveals that LDA and PBE functionals tend to underestimate and overestimate lattice constant a together with angle ?, respectively.",contradiction
"As a direct consequence, this tendency is also reflected in a deviation of the volume V values.",contradiction
"However, the following results are in a good agreement with the recent plane-wave calculations [2,11] demonstrating the reliability of our chosen basis set.",contradiction
"Although the revised functionals ? PBEsol, SOGGA, and WC ? appear worse than PBE for the evaluation of the Ni-O-Ni angle, their overall performance is systematically improved, especially for the aforementioned structural parameters, a,?, and V.",contradiction
"The decrease of MARE from 1.15% for PBE to 0.74% for SOGGA and impressive numbers of 0.41% and 0.35% for PBEsol and WC, correspondingly, leaves no doubt about the effectiveness of the modifications made to the revised density functionals for solids.",contradiction
A slightly worse result of SOGGA could be influenced by its different analytical form or more tightly bounded exchange [27].,contradiction
"One can note that the inclusion of the standard portion (25%) of the exact Hartree?Fock (HF) exchange ? as it is in the PBE0 scheme ? has a positive impact on the overall performance of PBE functional, since MARE now gets reduced to 0.92%.",contradiction
"Furthermore, the rejection of the long-range HF-type exchange in the HSE06 framework seems to have even a better effect.",contradiction
"As HSE06 outperforms PBE0 for nearly every structural parameter of rhombohedrally distorted LaNiO3, its MARE takes a value of 0.79% which is very close to the result of SOGGA.",contradiction
"Interestingly, HSE06 functional manages to almost ideally reproduce the experimentally determined value of volume V, although neither lattice constant a nor angle ? alone are improved in comparison to what was obtained using PBEsol or WC.",contradiction
"In this case, HSE06 benefits from an error cancellation which, according to the expression(2)V=a31+cos2?(2cos?-3),is likely if a and ? are correspondingly overestimated and underestimated (or vice versa) in respective proportions.",contradiction
"Another popular hybrid functional for the solid-state calculations, named B1WC, incorporates 16% of the exact full-range HF exchange.",contradiction
"In this work, a modified version mB1WC with PBE correlation was applied in order to find out the effect of HF exchange on solely the WC framework.",contradiction
"Unfortunately, Table 1 apparently indicates that mB1WC not only degrades the accuracy of its predecessor WC for all the structural parameters, but also is the worst performer among the considered hybrids with MARE reaching 1.48%.",contradiction
"It becomes obvious that the inclusion of some part of HF exchange is harmful for WC and, most probably, PBEsol and SOGGA functionals which already demonstrate reliable results in reproducing the crystalline structure of rhombohedral LaNiO3.",contradiction
"On the whole, the evaluated mean discrepancies between different DFT calculations and experiment do not exceed 1.5%, and in most cases this limit may seem to be acceptable.",contradiction
"However, for the sake of greater accuracy, we tighten functional selection criterion to 1%, therefore LDA, PBE, and mB1WC appear to be the ones that should be eliminated before making further calculations of elastic properties.",contradiction
"Concerning cubic and monoclinic LaNiO3, the direct comparison between DFT results and available experimental data lacks precision, but despite that some meaningful observations can still be made.",contradiction
"For example, we have noted that the discrepancies between calculated and measured (at 600øC) lattice constant of the cubic phase fall in the range from 1.39% (HSE06) to 1.91% (SOGGA) showing a similar performance of the remaining functionals.",contradiction
"A slightly more pronounced distribution can be noticed for the monoclinic geometry, as the hybrids ? PBE0 and HSE06 ? perform better in reproducing the stretched, while pure DFT functionals ? PBEsol, SOGGA, and WC ? the compressed structures.",contradiction
"MARE, which in this case comprises only lattice constants, monoclinic angle, and volume, under tensile strains varies from 1.28?1.41% for hybrids to 1.98?2.39% for pure DFT approaches, whereas under compressive strains the opposite is observed, since hybrids demonstrate values of 1.22?1.54% and pure DFT approaches improve to 0.82?0.95%.",contradiction
"Regarding all three phases of LaNiO3, the overall results of the chosen approximations so far imply that the hybrid scheme could serve as a reasonable alternative for the revised functionals in modelling the crystalline structure and thus the elastic features of LaNiO3.",contradiction
But this is not the end of the story.,contradiction
"Since simply reproducing the correct ground-state crystalline structure is not a sufficient criterion to properly evaluate the quality of the DFT approach performance [2], in Fig. 3 we also compare the density of states (DOS) obtained using the selected revised and hybrid functionals with experimentally observed spectrum of rhombohedral LaNiO3.",contradiction
"Here, it is clearly seen that hybrids fail to correctly describe the electronic structure exhibiting only two significantly shifted spectral features, while revised functionals demonstrate a fairly good agreement with the main energy peak positions A, B, and C.",contradiction
"As the experimental spectrum of monoclinic phase [53] bears a very close resemblance to the rhombohedral valence band presented in Fig. 3, one can deduce that the same tendency holds for the results of monoclinic calculations.",contradiction
The shapes of the cubic DOS are also not too different from the ones already discussed and it is very likely that future experimental measurements may reveal similarities to the valence band of rhombohedral LaNiO33.,contradiction
"Needless to say, such combination of accurately reproduced electronic and crystalline structures shown by PBEsol, SOGGA, and WC automatically captures our sympathy.",contradiction
"Besides, if one would take into account the computational time and resources required for the calculations, they would have another advantage over the hybrid scheme of PBE0 and HSE06.",contradiction
"Thus, to sum up, it can be stated that the revised functionals for solids appear to be the best choice among the tested DFT approximations for the next calculations of elastic properties of rhombohedral, cubic, and monoclinic LaNiO3.",contradiction
"Elastic properties allow one to evaluate many important mechanical and thermodynamic features of the material, thus in this paper we remedy the existing gap of knowledge by presenting single-crystal elastic constants and deduced polycrystalline parameters for the metallic perovskite LaNiO3.",contradiction
"For the sake of greater accuracy, a bunch of DFT approaches has been tested to reproduce the experimentally observed low-temperature crystalline and electronic structures of LaNiO3.",contradiction
"As the revised functionals for solids have demonstrated the best performance, they were chosen for the next calculations of elastic properties for the most common rhombohedral as well as high-temperature cubic and strain-induced monoclinic phases of LaNiO3.",contradiction
"The obtained results indicate that all three structures are mechanically stable, behave in a ductile manner, and exhibit a similar level of compressibility.",contradiction
"However, rhombohedral and monoclinic LaNiO3 are softer against uniaxial and shear deformations in comparison to the cubic phase, and this fact is somewhat reflected in the higher values of the Poisson?s ratio and lower ones for the Vickers hardness, sound velocities, and Debye temperature.",contradiction
"Concerning the elastic isotropy, it can be stated that, in general, LaNiO3 is more anisotropic in shear than in compression but the overall anisotropy is not strongly pronounced.",contradiction
It is also worth to note that rhombohedral and monoclinic phases demonstrate a very close polycrystalline behavior which in turn implies that LaNiO3 retains its mechanical properties when transforming from thin film to bulk material.,contradiction
We expect the obtained data and proposed insights to be useful for various practical applications and possible future experiments.,contradiction
"Transition metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides form an interesting class of compounds having an exceptional combination of physical properties including high melting points, high hardness values, high electrical and thermal conductivities and metallic lustre.",contradiction

An approach utilising Rayleigh SAWs and an assumed Poisson's ratio was used to determine the elastic moduli E and B at room temperature as well as at high temperatures up to 700øC.,contradiction

[1,2].",contradiction
"Following the first synthesized ultra-incompressible material OsB2 [3], extensive experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out for other TM borides in view of their synthesis is more straightforward.",contradiction

It is known that crystal structures are the key for the understanding of mechanical properties of materials.,contradiction
"However, common issues on the ambiguity of crystal structures still remain in transition metal borides on account of two points.",contradiction
"Firstly, the transition metal borides with metal-deficient or boron-deficient compositions can be easily obtained in actual experiments.",contradiction
"Secondly, the positions of boron atoms in crystal lattice are difficult to be determined by X-ray diffraction because of the large mass difference between TM and B atoms, particularly at extreme conditions (e.g., high pressure).",contradiction
"Therefore, theoretical prediction of crystal structures with the only known information of chemical composition independent of previous experimental knowledge is greatly necessary.",contradiction
"A promising material, WB4, has been synthesized at ambient pressure and was proposed to be superhard with claimed hardness of 31.8?46.2GPa [7], comparable to that (45?50GPa) of c-BN, though continuing debate exists in crystal structure.",contradiction
"Currently, it seems as if the experimental and theoretical studies have reached the consensus that WB4 adopts the hexagonal WB4-type structure (P63 /mmc, Z =4, hereafter denoted as Hex-I) [7?9].",contradiction
"Furthermore, Wang et al. [9] further predicted that Hex-I-ReB4 and Hex-I-TcB4 are all potential superhard materials by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",contradiction
"However, Zhao et al. [10] have found that the Hex-I-WB4 had large positive formation enthalpy (?0.37eV/atom) with respect to W and B under ambient conditions, indicating that it is metastable.",contradiction
"Recently, the MoB4-type structure (P63 /mmc, Z =2, hereafter denoted as Hex-II) proposed in our recent work [11] was identified as a potential ground state structure for WB4 by Gou et al. [12].",contradiction
"More recently, Zhang et al. [13] and Liang et al. [14,15] have revealed that the long regarded WB4 within Hex-I structure is actually WB3, which adopts the MoB3-type structure [16].",contradiction
"Strikingly, theoretical calculations for this newly identified stable WB3 structure correctly reproduce its structural and mechanical properties, as well as the experimental X-ray diffraction pattern.",contradiction
"Accordingly, exploring the ground state structure with the ideal stoichiometry B/W=4 and related mechanical of WB4 is highly desirable and of great interest.",contradiction
"In addition, the previous proposed Hex-I structure for ReB4 and TcB4 is based on the knowledge of known information.",contradiction
There is a possibility that hitherto unknown ground state structures are stable instead for these two compounds.,contradiction
"Here, we have extensively explored the ground state of TMB4 (TM=W, Re, and Tc) based on a global minimization of free-energy surfaces merging ab initio total energy calculations via Particle Swarm Optimization technique [17], unbiased by any known information.",contradiction

"Intriguingly, our structural prediction revealed a universally stable Hex-II structure for all TMB4 (TM=W, Re, and Tc) compounds.",contradiction
The Hex-II structure uncovered for these TMB4 is energetically much more preferable than the earlier proposed Hex-I structure at ambient conditions.,contradiction
"First principles calculations were then performed to characterize the structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and electronic properties of the Hex-II structure for all TMB4 compounds.",contradiction
The variable-cell structure predictions were performed at 0GPa with 1?4 formula units (f.u.) per simulation cell as implemented in the Crystal structure AnaLYsis by Particle Swarm Optimization (CALYPSO) code [25].,contradiction

"To illustrate the mechanical properties of these Hex-II-TMB4 compounds on a fundamental level, their total and site projected electronic densities of states (DOSs) were calculated at ambient pressure, as shown in Fig. 5 .",contradiction
The obtained DOS curves show large similarities in these compounds as follows.,contradiction
All these compounds exhibit clear metallic behavior by evidence of the finite electronic DOS at the Fermi level (EF ).,contradiction
"From the partial DOS, it reveals that the states from ?15 to 0eV mainly originate from TM-d and B-2p orbitals.",contradiction
"Moreover, the partial DOS profiles for both TM-d and B-2p are very similar in the range of ?15 to 0eV, reflecting the strong orbital hybridization between these two orbitals.",contradiction
"This fact also shows that a strong covalent interaction between the TM and B atom, as demonstrated in many other TM borides.",contradiction
"The typical feature of the total DOS is the presence of so-called pseudogap, which is considered as the borderline between the bonding and antibonding states [11,47,48].",contradiction
"For MoB4 and WB4, the EF is perfectly lying on the pseudogap, suggesting the p?d bonding states started to be saturated.",contradiction
This full occupation of the bonding states and without filling on the antibonding states enhances the stability of the Hex-II-MoB4 and Hex-II-WB4.,contradiction
"Compared to MoB4 and WB4, the TcB4 and ReB4 possess more valence electrons, and its bonding states are fully filled and the antibonding states are mainly occupied with the TM-d electrons.",contradiction

"In addition, the contribution to EF is mainly due to TM-d orbital which is the principal cause for metallicity in these Hex-II-TMB4 compounds.",contradiction
"To gain a more detailed insight into the bonding character of the Hex-II-TMB4, we have calculated the Electronic Localization Function (ELF) [49], which is based on a topological analysis related to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.",contradiction
The ELF is a contour plot in real space where different contours have values ranging from 0 to 1.,contradiction
A region with ELF=1 is where there is no chance of finding two electrons with the same spin.,contradiction

"To understand plastic deformation in the Hex-II-TMB4, the study of the dependence of the shear modulus on stress direction is also plotted in Fig. 4 .",contradiction
We choose a shear plane (h k l) and vary the shear stress direction [u v w] within that plane.,contradiction
The axis normal to the (h k l) plane is denoted as [H K L].,contradiction

"Firstly, the shear modulus of the Hex-II-TMB4 is independent of the shear directions from [101 ?0] to [1 ?21 ?0] directions within (0001) basal plane.",contradiction
"Secondly, except for Hex-II-MoB4, the shear modulus is the smallest on the (0001) basal plane, where the corresponding shear deformation involves a shear displacement between pure TM atoms (as shown in Fig. 1a).",contradiction
"In other words, these weak TM?TM layers, which are deformed easily by shear stresses in the a-direction and b-direction, reduce greatly the resistance of the Hex-II-TMB4 against large shear deformations in these easy-slip directions.",contradiction

"Li and Neuville (2010) calculated high-temperature adiabats for several major mantle minerals, concluding that the high P?T velocities of diopside are lower than those of olivine and garnet, but higher than those of Ca-poor orthopyroxene.",contradiction
"The consistency in the bulk elastic properties and pressure derivatives between this study and those of Li and Neuville (2010) reinforces the conclusions of the latter authors, which applies to isotropic aggregates of each mineral.",contradiction
"However, mantle xenoliths often display lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of the mineral grains, presumably from flow-induced shear deformation, resulting in acoustic anisotropy of mantle rocks (Pera et al., 2003).",contradiction
"The single-crystal moduli from this study show that the elastic anisotropy of clinopyroxene (cpx) is higher than the anisotropy of olivine from ambient conditions to pressures of 14 GPa (Fig. 4 ; Zha et al., 1998).",contradiction
"Here we have calculated the anisotropy using the ?Universal Anisotropy Index?, A u, of Ranganathan and Ostoja-Starzewski (2008).",contradiction

Similar arguments explain the anisotropy of shear waves in eclogite.,contradiction
"Although eclogites display only moderate velocity anisotropy of ?3% (Bascou et al., 2001), much stronger anisotropy is possible in eclogite if there is stronger LPO of the cpx grains.",contradiction

"Geophysical observations in the mantle transition zone (TZ), including seismic low velocity anomalies (LVZ), enhanced shear wave anisotropy, depth variations of seismic discontinuities, electric conductivity and seismic attenuation anomalies have been often related to locally enhanced water concentrations (Abers, 2000; Chen and Brudzinski, 2003, 2001; Deuss et al., 2013; Di Leo et al., 2012; Guo and Yoshino, 2013; Hacker et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2012; Khan and Shankland, 2012; Karato, 2006; Kawakatsu and Watada, 2007; Lawrence and Wysession, 2006; Tonegawa et al., 2008; Tsuji et al., 2008).",contradiction
"These geophysical anomalies are predominantly observed in the vicinity of subducted slabs supporting the transport of hydrated slab material into the TZ, where the water liberated from the slab can be ultimately stored over geological time due to the large water storage capacities of the major constituents, wadsleyite and ringwoodite (Karato et al., 2013).",contradiction
"Recently, direct evidence for the existence of a locally water-enriched TZ with a bulk water concentration of 1.0wt.% has been provided by the discovery of a hydrous ringwoodite sample enclosed in a diamond inclusion formed at about 550km depth (Pearson et al., 2014).",contradiction
"Even though a hydrous TZ has important implications for mantle geodynamics, a global picture of water concentrations and its variation in different TZ regions remains however incomplete and the amount of water transported via subduction into the TZ still remains elusive.",contradiction
"Phase equilibrium studies in hydrous peridotite have provided evidence for a series of dense hydrous magnesium silicate phases DHMS (phase A, E, superhydrous phase B and phase D), which are considered the major carriers of water in subduction zones (Iwamori, 2004; Kanzaki, 1991; Litasov and Ohtani, 2007; Ohtani et al., 2001; Poli and Schmidt, 2002; Schmidt and Poli, 1998).",contradiction
"Cold geothermal paths (i.e., below 600øC at 6GPa) that are typically followed by fast converging slabs in the Pacific (Abers et al., 2006; Syracuse et al., 2010; Van Keken et al., 2011) provide the thermal conditions to stabilize DHMS phases in the core of the slab and the cold peridotitic mantle in the vicinity of the subducted crust (Fig. 1 ) (Kaneshima et al., 2012; Tonegawa et al., 2008).",contradiction
"In these environments, water can be transported down to the transition zone through the formation of DHMS phases that preserve water released by the breakdown of antigorite (Litasov and Ohtani, 2007; Schmidt and Poli, 1998; Ulmer and Trommsdorff, 1999).",contradiction
"The water budgets derived from petrological studies show that the phase A bearing assembly formed after the decomposition of antigorite carries up to 4.6wt.% of water (Schmidt and Poli, 1998; Ulmer and Trommsdorff, 1999) which could be transferred to other DHMS at greater depths.",contradiction
"Among these phases, superhydrous phase B (hereafter ShyB, Mg10Si3H4O18, 5.8wt.% H2O) is the stable hydrous phase at the conditions of the transition zone (TZ) and uppermost lower mantle (ULM) and therefore, a potential water storage site in the slab at transition zone depth and likely in the vicinity of the slab (Fig. 1).",contradiction

"At warmer slab geotherms and at uppermost lower mantle depth, ShyB decomposes into perovskite, periclase and a hydrous fluid (Inoue et al., 2006; Kawamoto, 2004; Litasov and Ohtani, 2007; Ohtani et al., 2001; Komabayashi et al., 2005).",contradiction
"These fluids might be retained and stored over geological time by major phases in the TZ, ringwoodite and wadsleyite, ultimately leading to a water-enriched TZ (Karato et al., 2013; Kohlstedt et al., 1996).",contradiction
"The interpretation of seismic observations in deep subducted slabs in terms of hydration states relies to a large extent on the contrasting properties between hydrated and dry mantle regions (Abers, 2000; Hacker et al., 2003; Karato, 2006; Van Der Lee and Wiens, 2006).",contradiction
"Hydrous phases generally display lower seismic velocities and are rheologically weaker than their anhydrous counterparts (Jacobsen, 2006; Mainprice and Ildefonse, 2009; Mao et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014), hence they may significantly modify the seismic signatures of subducting slabs due to the formation of strong anisotropic microstructures resulting from the accommodation of much of the deformation in the slab (Faccenda, 2014; Faccenda et al., 2008; Jung and Karato, 2001).",contradiction
"For instance, hydrous phases such as ShyB and phase D easily align by a shape preferred orientation (SPO) or by a lattice preferred orientation (LPO) mechanism due to their layered structure (Fig. 2 ) and associated high plastic anisotropy (Mainprice and Ildefonse, 2009; Mussi et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2013a).",contradiction
The investigation of seismic anomalies at TZ depth in the vicinity of slabs remains a difficult task due to the limited seismic data coverage for most subduction zones.,contradiction
"In Tonga, Savage (2012) reported evidence for a 8km-thick low velocity layer a top of the cold slab displaying velocities up to 25% slower than the surrounding mantle, and perhaps extending down to 600km depth (region 1 in Fig. 1).",contradiction
A similar layer with reduced S-wave velocities of up to 8% at the slab mantle interface has been identified by Tonegawa et al. (2008) using receiver functions beneath Japan at depths between 200km and 500km.,contradiction
"While these low velocity layers have been associated to hydration, the origin of reported shear wave anisotropy at slab mantle-interfaces still remain speculative (Buttles and Olson, 1998; Di Leo et al., 2012; Kendall and Thomson, 1993; Ribe, 1989).",contradiction
"In northern Tonga low velocity and shear wave splitting anomalies in the slab (region 2 in Fig. 1) have been reported between 440km and 700km depth by broad band P- and S-wave forms and related to petrophysical anomalies (Brudzinski and Chen, 2000, 2003; Chen and Brudzinski, 2003).",contradiction
Deep sub-slab shear wave anisotropy (region 3 in Fig. 1) has been reported beneath the slab in southern Taiwan by Hu et al. (2012) due to enhanced normal mode coupling at TZ depth.,contradiction
Di Leo et al. (2012) found sub-slab anisotropy in the Sangihe subduction zone at TZ depth with splitting delays of up to 1.5s and trench parallel fast directions (V SH > V SV).,contradiction
Similar splitting geometries but greater delay times of up to 3s have been reported near the northern Tonga subduction zone by Chen and Brudzinski (2003) and in the sub-slab mantle at TZ depth by Foley and Long (2011).,contradiction
Wookey et al. (2002) observed large shear wave splittings of up to 6s with V SH > V SV at ULM depth beneath the Australian plate in the Tonga subduction zone.,contradiction
These splitting delays could be related to a 100-km-thick layer with moderate anisotropy just below the 660km discontinuity.,contradiction
"While a contribution from anisotropy above 660km depth could not be ruled out by Wookey et al. (2002), it may not be associated to slab anisotropy as suggested by Fischer and Wiens (1996) and Fouch and Fischer (1996).",contradiction
"Interestingly, Kaneshima (2013) found strong sub-slab scatterers in the cold peridotitic mantle below the Tonga slab at TZ depths, that may be caused by strong anisotropic fabrics.",contradiction
"While the anomalies observed at shallow depth have been attributed to the presence of textured serpentine, DHMS phases could be potential sources for the anomalies at greater depth based on the thermal structure of the slabs (Iwamori, 2007; Kawakatsu and Watada, 2007; Tonegawa et al., 2008; Tsuji et al., 2008; Van Keken et al., 2011; Zhao and Ohtani, 2005).",contradiction
"Fabrics in the main constituent of the lower TZ (i.e., ringwoodite) might not explain the observations because of its relative moderate degree of elastic and plastic anisotropy (Carrez et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006; Mao et al., 2012).",contradiction
Anisotropic fabrics of perovskite could serve as a potential explanation of ULM anisotropy but its deformation mechanisms and elastic properties are not sufficiently constrained for a detailed analysis.,contradiction
"Recently, experimental studies of the mechanical properties of phase D have shown that LVZ, shear splitting delay times as well as the splitting geometry V SH > V SV observed in the northern part of the Tonga subduction zone at ULM mantle depths could be explained by the presence of 16vol.% of textured phase D in a hydrous subducted peridotite containing 1.2wt.% of water (Rosa et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2012).",contradiction
"Interestingly, the sub-slab anisotropy below Taiwan has been ascribed to anisotropic fabrics of hydrous phases (Hu et al., 2012) and particularly, ShyB has been pointed as a candidate to explain sub-slab scatterers below the Tonga slab at TZ depths (Kaneshima, 2013).",contradiction
Whether the observed features at TZ depth are related to hydration relies on a better understanding of the physical properties of candidate hydrous phases in the slab which are not available in most cases.,contradiction
"In this contribution, we investigate the single-crystal elasticity of ShyB to transition zone pressures by Brillouin scattering spectroscopy and diamond anvil cell techniques.",contradiction
"Combined with information on the deformation mechanisms of ShyB, the results are applied to model the effect of ShyB (and hydration) on the seismic velocity profiles and anisotropy in subducting slabs in the TZ and ULM.",contradiction

Estimated errors on the individual Cij are 0.5?1% for the on-diagonal constants and 2?3% for the off-diagonal constants.,contradiction
The larger errors on the off-diagonal constants are related to the larger covariance and to the difficulty to constrain experimentally the second polarization of the shear wave mode (Fig. 4).,contradiction
The two polarizations of the shear mode (V SH and V SV) were only observed simultaneously in some crystallographic orientations (Figs.

"Indeed, the obtained volume compression curve derived from the present study (Fig. S4) is in good agreement with the results of Crichton et al. (1999) and stands in-between the above mentioned X-ray and first-principles pressure?volume data-sets.",contradiction
"Furthermore, the obtained axial moduli Ki ,0 and their pressure derivates Ki ? are in good agreement with reported literature values (Table S1).",contradiction
"We therefore conclude that the discrepancies in the EoS parameters K T and K T? outlined above, may not originate from distinct chemical compositions of the samples (i.e., water or iron content and Mg/Si ratio) but from the characteristic trade-off between K T ? K T? in the PVT equation of state.",contradiction
"The compositional relations between the DHMS phases and other phases in peridotite results in general trends in the elastic behavior with changing water content, crystal structure or density that have been discussed previously (Angel et al., 2001; Sanchez-Valle et al., 2006; Jacobsen et al., 2008).",contradiction
"Among the DHMS phases, ShyB displays the second highest aggregate moduli after phase D and shows higher stiffness and shear resistance compared to phase A and E (Table S2).",contradiction
This trend is in agreement with the strong correlation between the aggregate moduli of DHMS phases and their density or pressure stabilities which has been described by Angel et al. (2001).,contradiction
"The larger aggregate moduli and densities of ShyB and phase D are related to specific structural characteristics, including the occurrence of silicon cations in octahedral coordination and the increase in edge-sharing units.",contradiction
The structure of ShyB is closely related to phase D even though only one third of the silicon cations are in octahedral coordination in ShyB in contrast to phase D where all silicon cations are in octahedral coordination.,contradiction
"With the aim of evaluating the contribution of ShyB fabrics to the observed shear wave anisotropy in deep subduction zones, the development of preferential alignment of ShyB crystals upon plastic deformation was simulated employing the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) code of Lebensohn and Tome (1993).",contradiction
"In the simulation, 500 randomly oriented ShyB grains were deformed in 20 strain increments of 2% resulting in a von Mises equivalent strain of 40%.",contradiction
The relative low number of grains was chosen to improve the computational speed.,contradiction
"The aggregate was compressed uniaxially with a strain rate of 5ž10?16 s?1, compatible with the down dip compression regime and strain rates in deep slabs (Alisic et al., 2010; Vavrycuk, 2006).",contradiction
"In the model, the stress exponent (n) was chosen equivalent to that of olivine (n =3) and the effects of dynamic recrystallization and slip hardening were disregarded due to the lack of data for ShyB (Tommasi et al., 2000; Wenk, 1998).",contradiction
Elongated grains with the longest axis parallel to the crystallographic b-axis were employed and the grain shapes were incrementally updated in the model to mimic the morphology of ShyB crystals observed in the synthesis products.,contradiction
Slip systems of ShyB and their relative activities were adjusted following the experimental results of Mussi et al. (2013).,contradiction
ShyB displays an enhanced plastic anisotropy carrying deformation mostly by the basal slip modes.,contradiction
"This observation is in agreement with the location of the weak hydrogen-bondings in ShyB (Pacalo and Parise, 1992).",contradiction
"Therefore, basal slip systems including (010) [100] and (010) [001] were considered in the model as the weakest slip modes and yields the lowest critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) values, resulting in high slip activities.",contradiction
"Other possible slip modes such as (010)?101?, {111}?101?, (001) [100] that are activate under higher stresses were assigned higher CRSS values in the model.",contradiction
"A second order linearization formalism was used for the VPSC simulation, which is the most appropriate for materials displaying high plastic anisotropy.",contradiction
"The resulting preferential alignment of ShyB-crystals in the aggregate are presented as pole figures projections (PF) of the three poles [100], [010] and [001] that describe the distribution of a crystallographic direction relative to the deformation environment (Fig. 10 ).",contradiction
The poles are projected into the plane perpendicular to the compression axis (Z?X plane in Fig. 10).,contradiction
"Upon uniaxial compression, ShyB crystals preferentially align the crystallographic b-axis ([010] poles) sub-parallel with the compression axis (Y direction in Fig. 10).",contradiction
"The crystallographic a- and c-axis ([001] and [001] poles) are oriented perpendicular to the maximum strain axis and the maximum densities plot close to the Z and X directions, respectively.",contradiction
"At a von Mises equivalent strain of 20%, [010] poles show the highest pole density (2.6m.r.d) compared to [100] and [001] poles.",contradiction
This [010] texture strengthens with increasing strain up to 40% strain.,contradiction
The strong [010] texture of ShyB in our model originates mainly from the high activity of basal slip modes that dominate the deformation behavior.,contradiction
"An opposite alignment of the b-axis, e.g., perpendicular to the compression axis, would be expected if the SPO mechanism which is controlled by grain morphology, would dominate.",contradiction
We conclude therefore that the LPO mechanism seems to be inferior to the SPO mechanism in our models.,contradiction
"The seismic properties of the textured aggregate of ShyB were calculated at selected pressures of 10GPa and 17.5GPa using the modeled texture at strains of 20% and 40% together with the elastic properties derived in this study (Table 1) (Mainprice, 1990).",contradiction
The spatial distributions of the polarization anisotropy (ASPo) of the textured ShyB aggregates at 10 and 17.5GPa are presented as wave velocity surfaces in Fig. 10.,contradiction
"After 20% of the strain, a deformed ShyB aggregate displays maximal and minimal ASPo perpendicular and parallel to the compression axis, respectively.",contradiction
The strength of the anisotropy of 0.6% at 10GPa changes marginally with increasing pressure.,contradiction
"With increasing strain, however, the location of the maximal anisotropy migrates from the compressional plane towards the compression axis.",contradiction
"In addition, the appearance of the maximal anisotropy changes upon deformation from a directional (pointing between the X and Z axis) to circular and the strength of the anisotropy increases to 1.1% at 40% of the strain.",contradiction
"Conversely, the polarization direction of the fast shear wave remains unchanged with increasing pressure and strain.",contradiction
"This implies that the overall delay time between two polarized shear waves measured at a seismic station will depend on the depth distribution and deformation state of the ShyB fabrics in the mantle, but the polarization direction of the fast shear wave arrival will not show modulation.",contradiction
The characteristic change of the ASPo in ShyB fabrics with depth and strain might therefore serve as a useful diagnostic tool to identify hydrated regions at depth (Fig. 10).,contradiction
Fig. 7 illustrates the evolution of the aggregate compressional V P and shear wave V S velocities of ShyB with pressure compared to those of representative phases in hydrous and anhydrous peridotitic lithologies.,contradiction
"The aggregate velocities of ShyB are significantly lower than those of the major anhydrous phases in peridotite, with the exception of majorite (Mj).",contradiction
"The velocity contrasts between ShyB and the dominant phase of the lower TZ, anhydrous iron-bearing ringwoodite (Fe-Rw) are on the order of 2% for both V P and V S.",contradiction
"In an uppermost lower mantle (ULM) phase assembly, the velocity differences between ShyB and the volumetrically dominant phase iron-bearing magnesium perovskite (Mg-pv) are the largest with up to 10% for V P and up to 14% for V S.",contradiction
ShyB exhibits significantly lower aggregate velocities than those of calcium-perovskite (Ca-pv) with negative differences of 5% for V P and 7% for VS.,contradiction
"Compared to ferropericlase (with 15mol.% of iron, Fe15-Pc), ShyB exhibits lower shear velocities by about 2.2% but compressional velocities higher by about 3.5%.",contradiction
"Interestingly, the velocity contrasts between ShyB and its coexisting hydrous phases are only moderate: aluminum- and iron-bearing phase D (AlFe-phase D) display aggregate velocities about 1% lower than ShyB whereas the velocity contrast with hydrous iron-bearing ringwoodite (hy-Fe-Rw) is negligible (ñ0.4%).",contradiction
"The velocity contrasts between hydrous and anhydrous lithologies are major tools in the remote sensing of water (Abers, 2000; Hacker et al., 2003; Kawakatsu and Watada, 2007; Nolet and Zielhuis, 1994).",contradiction
The velocity differences between ShyB and representative phases in dry peridotitic lithologies suggest that a hydrous ShyB-bearing peridotitic rock might be well distinguishable from an anhydrous peridotite using seismic imaging techniques.,contradiction
"However, the seismic discrimination between ShyB and AlFe-phase D at Earth?s mantle conditions might be very difficult if the low velocity contrast between these two phases persists at high-pressure and high-temperature conditions.",contradiction
"Similarly, the low velocity contrasts between ShyB and hy-Fe-Rw might hinder their seismic discrimination.",contradiction
"However, it is important to point out that the velocities compared here correspond to the magnesium end-member composition of ShyB.",contradiction
"In natural peridotite, magnesium substitution by minor amounts of iron and aluminum is likely to occur and can reduce further the aggregate velocities of ShyB as reported for other phases (e.g., Wang et al., 2014).",contradiction
It is therefore plausible that the aggregate velocities of ShyB in natural mantle rocks are lower than those of hy-Fe-Rw.,contradiction
"The compressional (A P) and the shear (A S) wave velocity anisotropy of ShyB up to high pressure were determined using the relationship:(2)Ai=200?(Vi,max-Vi,min)(Vi,max+Vi,min)where the terms (Vi ,max ? Vi ,min) and (Vi ,max + Vi ,min) respectively correspond to the difference and the sum between the maximum and minimum of the acoustic velocities (i =P or S) of ShyB.",contradiction
The pressure dependence of the A P and A S is listed in Table 1.,contradiction
"At ambient conditions, the anisotropy reaches a maximum of 6.9% for the compressional waves and 11.6% for the shear waves.",contradiction
"Upon compression, A P and A S decrease by about 50% down to 2.4% and 5.9% at 15GPa, respectively.",contradiction
"Above this pressure, the A S slightly increases to 7.1%, due to differences in the pressure evolution of the components of the Cij stiffness tensor (Fig. 6).",contradiction
"The overall decrease in anisotropy of ShyB upon compression to ULM and TZ conditions is consistent with the behavior of other phases in hydrous peridotitic lithologies (Mainprice and Ildefonse, 2009).",contradiction
"In addition, the shear wave polarization anisotropy (ASPo) of ShyB, which is defined as the maximal difference in the velocities of the two orthogonally polarized shear waves in a given crystallographic direction, was evaluated using the relationship:(3)ASPo=100x(VS1-VS2)maxVS,VRHwhere (V S1 ? V S2)max is the maximum value of the difference between the fast (V S1) and the slow (V S2) shear waves along the same crystallographic direction, and V S,VRH is the Voigt?Reuss?Hill average of the aggregate shear velocities.",contradiction
The spatial distribution of ASPo is presented as wave?velocity surfaces for three selected pressure in Fig. 8 .,contradiction
"Four maxima of ASPo can be distinguished along the symmetrically equivalent ?122? directions, whereas minima are situated along the b-axis and close to the a- and c-axis.",contradiction
"Upon compression the loci of the extremes remain unchanged, except for the minima located along the b-axis that moves towards the c-axis with pressure.",contradiction
"Overall, the maximum anisotropy ASPo declines upon compression.",contradiction
"Compared to the shear wave anisotropy, the ASPo displays lower maxima of 10.2% at ambient condition and 5.8% at 17.5GPa (Fig. 8).",contradiction
The single-crystal shear wave anisotropy (A S) of ShyB and main coexisting phases in a hydrous peridotite up to lower mantle pressures are illustrated in Fig. 9 .,contradiction
"At lower TZ depths, ShyB displays a higher anisotropy than hy-Fe-Rw, Mj and Ca-pv.",contradiction
"In a peridotitic ULM phase assembly, ShyB has the second highest A S after Mg-Pv, closely followed by Fe15-Pc.",contradiction
"However, the single-crystal seismic anisotropy compared here represents only the upper limit of the anisotropy in a mono-crystalline aggregate in the special case where all the crystals in the aggregate are aligned.",contradiction
"Plastic deformation mechanisms such as lattice preferred orientation (LPO) and shape preferred orientation (SPO) will typically lead to a reduction of the shear anisotropy by 2?3 orders of magnitudes (i.e., Wentzcovitch et al., 1998).",contradiction
Mussi et al. (2013) investigated the plastic deformation mechanisms of ShyB and showed that it aligns easily in a non-hydrostatic stress field forming strong LPO textures.,contradiction
"ShyB preferentially aligns the stacking fault axis (b-axis) parallel to the maximal stress axis similarly to the deformation behavior observed for other hydrous layered phases, including phase D (Rosa et al., 2013a).",contradiction
"Furthermore, owing to the elongated grain shape of ShyB observed during synthesis in this study and by Litasov and Ohtani (2003), it is likely that ShyB crystals also align in an aggregate through a SPO mechanism.",contradiction
The effects of textures on the anisotropy of ShyB are discussed in the following section.,contradiction
"Hydrous phases are likely the main sources of seismic shear anomalies because they often display lower strength than their dry counterparts and therefore form the strongest LPO in a rock (Chen et al., 1998; Girard et al., 2013; Kavner, 2003; Rosa et al., 2013a).",contradiction
"Hydrous phases at depth might be most likely formed and/or preserved along fluid pathways, hence favoring the strain localization along shear bands that contain rheologically weak (hydrous) phases.",contradiction
"Such a behavior has been observed in experimental and field studies for hydrous upper mantle rocks (Hilairet et al., 2007; Seaman et al., 2013) and also proposed for phase D based on its relative low strength properties compared to coexisting ULM phases (Rosa et al., 2013a).",contradiction
"Shear wave anisotropy observed in various subduction zones is likely related to the LPO of hydrous phases, especially in cold subduction zones where hydrous regions are plausible and slab lithologies are subjected to high non-hydrostatic stresses (Hu et al., 2012; Kaneshima, 2013; Mainprice and Ildefonse, 2009; Rosa et al., 2013a).",contradiction
"The results presented in Fig. 10 show that the maximal polarization anisotropy, ASPo, displayed by textured ShyB at the pressures of the lower transition zones (0.6?1.1%) fall into the range of shear wave splitting (between 0.9ñ0.3%) measured in the vicinity of deep subducting zones including Tonga and Sangihe (Chen and Brudzinski, 2003; Di Leo et al., 2012; Wookey et al., 2002).",contradiction
"However, ShyB fabrics generated in down-dip compressional regime induce a shear wave splitting geometry with V SV > V SH for seismic waves traveling across the aggregate.",contradiction
"This shear wave pattern is incompatible with the array polarization geometry, V SH > V SV, observed in Tonga or in Sangihe.",contradiction
"Even though the modeled ShyB fabrics display a high degree of seismic anisotropy, they cannot explain the seismic observations in Tonga and the sub-slab mantle in Sangihe, unless the elastic properties of ShyB change significantly at the high temperatures of the TZ.",contradiction
"These observations emphasize the role of phase D as a potential candidate to explain the lower transition zone and ULM anisotropy as it forms textures under compression that match the observations (Rosa et al., 2013a).",contradiction
"At intermediate transition zone depths, however, the presence of strongly textured phase D in coexistence with ShyB could explain the observed anisotropy because the textures in hydrous peridotite, and hence the wave polarization, would be controlled by phase D.",contradiction
"This scenario would require high water concentrations in the bulk rock (>3wt.%, (Komabayashi et al., 2005; Litasov et al., 2007)) to ensure the coexistence of phase D and ShyB and therefore, a mechanism to form very-hydrous regions at this depth.",contradiction
"If isolated, very hydrous regions could exist at TZ depth that accommodate most of the strain, strong petrofabrics of hydrous phases such as phase D and/or ShyB could account for the deep shear wave anisotropy reported beneath the slab in southern Taiwan (Hu et al., 2012) and the seismic sub-slab scatterers observed below the Tonga slab (Kaneshima, 2013).",contradiction
"Detail study of the elasticity and strength of ShyB and phase D at the relevant conditions of the deep mantle are however still necessary to assess better their effect on the seismic signatures in deep subduction zones and ultimately, to constrain the amount of water stored at depth in hydrous phases.",contradiction
"To identify the seismic signature of ShyB and hydration in subducted slabs, we have calculated the seismic velocity contrasts between hydrous and dry peridotitic lithologies at relevant high pressure and high temperature conditions for the slab in the TZ and UPM (up to 1000øC and 26GPa).",contradiction
Two different bulk rock compositions were chosen to represent the three hydration sites in a subduction zone corresponding to Fig. 1.,contradiction
The dry pyrolitic (region 1 and 3) and harzburgitic (region 2) bulk rock compositions were taken from Litasov and Ohtani (2007) while the compositions for the hydrated lithologies were renormalized for a water content of 1.2wt.%.,contradiction
"This water content was derived from seismic anomalies in Tonga below the TZ (Rosa et al., 2013a, 2012) and falls at the upper limit of water reported locally for the TZ from various studies (Pearson et al., 2014; Mao et al., 2012).",contradiction
Stable phase assemblages in dry and hydrous lithologies were taken from Litasov and Ohtani (2007).,contradiction
"For the calculations, ShyB was considered as the only stable DHMS phase in the TZ and ULM.",contradiction
"Although ShyB and phase D may coexists between 16GPa and 28 GPa in very hydrous systems (>3wt.% bulk water, (Komabayashi et al., 2005; Litasov et al., 2007)), it is reasonable to assume for the calculations that ShyB is the only stable DHMS phase in the TZ and ULM (Litasov et al., 2007) when the bulk water in the system is around 1wt.%.",contradiction
"The continuous change in composition of majoritic garnet with depth was taken into account in our calculations by the implementation of two different majoritic garnet compositions, TZ-garnet and ULM-garnet (see Table 3 ), referring to the compositions found by Litasov and Ohtani (2003) at 1000øC and 22GPa and at 1000øC and 25GPa, respectively.",contradiction
The weight fractions of each phase in the dry and hydrous lithologies were calculated using a linearization procedure similar to Rosa et al. (2012) and converted to volumetric fractions for the further calculations (Fig. S5).,contradiction
"Phase transitions of the major mantle constituent?s ringwoodite and garnet were considered by calculating the phase proportion changes from the known decomposition reactions (Ghosh et al., 2013; Kubo et al., 2002).",contradiction
Densities and elastic moduli of individual phases were then calculated along two slab isotherms of 800øC and 1000øC and up to 26GPa from the thermoelastic properties listed in Table 3 following the procedure detailed in Sanchez-Valle et al. (2008).,entailment
"Finally, the velocity contrasts (?Vi ) between aggregate velocities of the hydrous (V hy) and dry (V dry) peridotitic lithologies were determined using the relation:(4)?i=100?(Vdry-Vhy)Vhywith i =P or S.",contradiction
The resulting aggregate velocities for the dry and hydrous peridotitic lithologies together with their velocity contrasts are presented in Fig. 11 .,contradiction
The calculated aggregate velocities of hydrous peridotitic compositions are reduced by 1?2.5% compared to dry lithologies in the investigated PT domain for both compressional waves (V P) and shear waves (V S).,contradiction
"Similarly to difference in bulk rock composition (harzburgitic or pyrolitic), temperature variations in the order of 200øC only marginally affect the absolute velocity contrasts.",contradiction
The effect of hydration on the calculated negative velocity contrast is slightly higher for the compressional waves (?V P =1.5?2.3%) at lower TZ depth compared to the shear waves (?V S =1.1?1.6%).,contradiction
"While the velocity contrasts for shear waves increases at ULM conditions up to 2% for a pyrolitic compositions and 2.5% for harzburgitic, the compressional wave contrasts decrease slightly to 1.5% for both lithologies.",contradiction
These changes mainly reflect changes of the stable mineral assemblies coexisting with ShyB and the differences in volume fractions between phases represented in both dry and hydrous lithologies.,contradiction
"Especially Fe15-Pc, which is slightly less abundant in a ULM assembly compared to a dry assembly (Fig. S5), may contribute to the observed evolution of velocity contrast in the ULM also due to its lower compressional wave velocities but higher shear wave velocities compared to ShyB (Fig. 7).",contradiction
"The results discussed above suggest that the presence of ShyB in cold subducted slabs could contribute to the low velocity anomalies reported in Tonga, including the reduced velocity layer on top of the slab that extends down to 600km depth (Savage, 2012) or the negative velocity contrast of about 3% from the southern to northern region in the Tonga subduction zone (region II to region I in Brudzinski and Chen (2000, 2003)) at intermediate depths within the transition zone.",contradiction
"However, the calculations predict a constant velocity contrast throughout the TZ and fail to reproduce the progressive increase in the velocity contrast observed seismically between 440km and 700km between the two slab regions.",contradiction
"This indicates that ShyB alone cannot be the origin of the anomalies and that the progressive increase of the volume fraction of phase D with pressure would be required to explain the enhanced velocity contrast with depth (Rosa et al., 2012).",contradiction
Boron nitride (BN) has been the long-term subject of extensive theoretical and experimental studies for its wide industrial applications.,contradiction
"Similar to C element, BN can form many polymorphs, such as hexagonal BN (h-BN) [1], zinc blende BN (c-BN) [2], wurtzite BN (w-BN) [3], BN fullerene [4], BN nanotubes [5], 5H-BN [6], and amorphous BN [7], which will lead to the large diversity in mechanical properties for its multiplied atomic bonding.",contradiction
"In recent years, some new BN allotropes are reported in succession [8?13], and their particular electronic and mechanical properties have been studied.",contradiction
"Although many different BN allotropes are proposed, there are still no perfect superhard material candidates, which may be placed as a good competitor to diamond and c-BN for abrasive, cutting tools, coating, and maybe extensively applied in industrial applications.",contradiction
"Therefore, there is still a long way to go for exploring new novel superhard materials with high incompressional strength, thermal conductivity, refractive index and chemical stability, especially the high hardness.",contradiction
There is no doubt that the work for exploring new superhard material is a very meaningful and urgent work.,contradiction
"In this work, we propose a novel superhard structure of BN with an orthorhombic (space group is Pbam, 32 atoms per unit cell) structure (O-BN).",contradiction

"Polycrystalline indium (In) and lithium (Li) doped SnO2 [66] show strong electrical properties, and they are optically transparent.",contradiction
The reason for the coexistence of electrical conductivity and optical transparency is mostly unclear.,contradiction

"It has been shown that Sni and VO dominate the defect structure of SnO2 due to the multivalence of Sn, explaining the natural nonstoichiometry of this material.",contradiction
That these defects produce shallow donor levels explains n-type conduction in undoped SnO2.,contradiction
This also explains that SnO2 can have a high carrier concentration with minor effects on its transparency.,contradiction

Over the years the synthesis and characterization of the low dimensional inorganic nanostructured materials have received much attention because of their possible applications in a wide range of technological fields.,contradiction

It is known for a long time that the absorption of gas on the certain oxide semiconductor surface can cause a considerable change in the electrical resistivity of the sample [114].,contradiction

The gas sensing mechanism is described as the adsorption?desorption process of oxygen on the surface of the sensing materials.,contradiction
"The formation of oxygen adsorbates (O2- or O?) leads to a space charge region on the surface of the metal oxide, resulting in an electron depleted surface layer due to electron transfer from the surface to oxygen.",contradiction
The change in the conductivity of the sensing element with the reduction in grain size can be thus attributed to the penetrability of the depletion layer into the interconnecting grains.,contradiction
"Although semiconductor gas sensors based on SnO2 have already been in the market, there is vast room for modifications of the sensing properties, such as sensitivity and selectivity to meet its ever-expanding demands.",contradiction
"Both sensitivity and selectivity also depend on the distribution, chemical state, and cluster size of the added noble metals and, therefore, depend on the synthesis process [121].",contradiction
The sensing materials between two electrodes can be assumed as a large grain cluster whose each and every constituting elementary grain contributes to the conductivity and thus the total system acts as a single mean grain.,contradiction
"The sensitivity and selectivity, to some extent, have been tuned by using different catalysts, promoters and by varying the operating temperature [122?124].",contradiction
The role of different dopants on the gas sensing behavior of SnO2 have also been studied to obtain high-performance sensors [125?128].,contradiction

"Sb doped SnO2 nanowire based gas sensors have promising application for ethanol sensing with low resistance, quick response and recovery times [131].",contradiction
"It was found that introduction of small quantities of noble metals (such as palladium (Pd) or platinum (Pt)) increases the sensitivity towards some gases (i.e. improves selectivity) and the sensor can be operated at lower sensing temperatures (i.e. improving stability) [115,132?135].",contradiction
Cu doped SnO2 nanowire is good for H2S sensing [136].,contradiction
"Moreover, many reports described the mechanism behind the gas sensing capabilities of nanowires, nanorods, and other nanoforms, and those will be discussed in detail in this review [119,137?143].",contradiction

"We have compiled a detail survey on the existing literature and discussed different technical, experimental details and theoretical conclusions to ascertain the fundamental mechanism that directs such formations.",contradiction
"It not only provides a scope to study the electrical and thermal transport in the regime of quantum confinement, but also is expected to play an important role in both interconnection and functional units in fabricating electronic, optoelectronic, and sustainable energy devices with nanoscale dimension.",contradiction
In an attempt to relate the size of the SnO2 nanocrystals to the onset of phase transformation Jiang et al. [157] reported a preliminary high-pressure study of SnO2 with average grain sizes of 8nm and about 10?m and found that for both SnO2 samples the onset pressure of the rutile-to-cubic phase transition is almost the same about 18GPa.,contradiction
"Among earlier works on the effect of particle size on the transformation pressure, Tolbert et al. [165?167] found that the smaller the crystallites, the higher is the transformation pressure.",contradiction
The explanation for this finding was based on the surface energy differences between the phases involved.,contradiction
"There are other reports on nanocrystalline ZnO [168], ZnS [169] or PbS [170] supporting the observations.",contradiction
"Unfortunately, except one report [157], no other report attempted to find out the relation between the phase transformation of nanocrystalline SnO2 and the surface energy or other thermodynamic effects.",contradiction
"Later, He et al. [171] found that the onset transition pressures for the rutile-to-cubic phase transition are 23ñ2GPa for bulk SnO2 and 29ñ2GPa, and 30ñ2GPa for 14nm and 8nm nanocrystalline SnO2, respectively.",contradiction
"Interestingly, for smaller 3nm nanocrystalline SnO2, no cubic phase was detected even at 39GPa.",contradiction
"As seen in Fig. 4 , the onset transition pressures for the rutile-to-cubic phase transition with the crystallite size are 23ñ2GPa, 29ñ2GPa and 30ñ2GPa for bulk SnO2, 14nm and 8nm, respectively.",contradiction
The driving force for this structural transformation is the reduction in Gibbs energy (G) from the original (phase 1) to final structure (phase 2).,contradiction
"The difference of transition pressures from phase 1 to phase 2 for both bulk and nanocrystals was derived as:(3)PnT-PBT=PBT(?VB(PBT)/?Vn(PnT)-1)+(Unsurf(2,PnT)-Unsurf(1,PnT))/?Vn(PnT)+((UB(1,PBT)-UB(1,PnT))-(UB(2,PBT)-UB(2,PnT)))/?Vn(PnT),where B and n refer to bulk and nanocrystals, respectively, Unsurf is the internal surface energy per mole, U B is the internal energy in bulk, P is the pressure, V n is the volume per mole, ?Vn(PnT)=Vn(1,PnT)-Vn(2,PnT) and ?VB(PBT)=VB(1,PBT)-VB(2,PBT) [157].",contradiction
"Unsurf=?AN, where ? is the average surface tension, A is the surface area of the crystal and N is the number of crystals per mole.",contradiction
"From the expression, it is clear that the transition pressure, PnT, in nanocrystals depends on three components: (1) the volume change for bulk and nanocrystals at transitions, (hereafter, is denoted as Term 1); (2) the surface energy difference between the phases involved, (hereafter, is denoted as Term 2); and (3) the internal energy difference between the phases involved in bulk, (hereafter, is denoted as Term 3).",contradiction
"Thus, it is seen from Fig. 5 that as the crystallite size decreases, the transition pressure increases.",contradiction
"The driving force for the enhancement of transition pressure in nanocrystalline SnO2 samples is mainly due to the Term 2, the surface energy differences, although the Term 1 favors a reduction of the transition pressure.",contradiction
"Other factors, such as defects and lattice strain in samples also contribute to the transition pressure.",contradiction
The surface energy difference between cubic and rutile SnO2 phases was estimated to be about 1.6?1.7J/m2.,contradiction
"It reveals that the surface energy difference between rutile and fluorite type SnO2 phases at the onset transition pressure, PnT?PBT?18GPa, is very small [157].",contradiction
"Based on the works of Tolbert et al. [165?167], information about the dependence of phase transformation of nanocrystals on the surface and thermodynamic energy can be evaluated.",contradiction
"The internal energies for the high and low pressure phases of the nanocrystals are given by(4)Ulp(P,V)=TQlp-PVlp+?lpNlp-?lpAlpUhp(P,V)=TQhp-PVhp+?hpNlp-?hpAhpwhere U, Q, and ? are the bulk like internal energy, entropy and chemical potential terms, respectively, for each phase at low pressure (lp) and high pressure (hp).",contradiction
"The surface energy in each phase varies as(5)S?i=c1,i+c2,ir2Here c 1 corresponds to the bulk surface energy of some hypothetical average low index surface.",contradiction
"In the limit of large size, only the c 1 term remains.",contradiction
The c 2 term corresponds to the increase in surface energy due to the curvature of the cluster.,contradiction
"For spherical nanocrystals, this term varies at 1/r 2.",contradiction
"The c 2 term can be thought of as the increase in ? caused by steps and edges, which must be induced in a low index surface in order to make it curve into a sphere.",contradiction
The constants in Eq. (5) can be determined from the size dependence of the lattice contraction at atmospheric pressure using Eq. (6) (also known as Laplace law).,contradiction
"This equation relates the observed lattice contraction of a spherical cluster to the surface tension through the concept of surface pressure [172] (6)Ps=2?(r)r=?aa3B0This equation though valid for a completely homogeneous, spherical system with no surface structure, still it has been applied to non-crystalline solid and also for calculating surface energy for wurtzite phase [166].",contradiction
It has been observed that the entropy change on transformation is small enough and so the TQi as terms in Eq. (4) are dropped in actual calculations of thermodynamic parameters.,contradiction
"Given that the condition for a phase transition to occur is ?lp=?hp, the necessary condition for a phase transition in a nanocrystals system (PnT) is given by(7)PnT(Vlp-Vhp)+Ulp(PnT)-Uhp(PnT)=?hpAhp-?lpAlpThe final term of the above equation depends only upon the nanocrystal surface area and the surface tension.",contradiction
The surface area in each phase is calculated from the volume assuming the spherical crystallites.,contradiction
The concept of a transition mode is equivalent to the statement that the connectivity of the atoms cannot completely change during a transition.,contradiction
"As the shape of the unit cell changes upon transition, this connectivity necessitates a change in the overall shape of the crystallite.",contradiction
This effect is not easily observed in the bulk because the fragmentation of large crystals due to nucleation in multiple spots masks any local shape change.,contradiction
"In nanocrystals, however, where entire crystallites transform coherently, a path driven macroscopic shape change should produce detectable results.",contradiction
"The surface energy offset and the lattice contraction vary with crystal size, with the smallest nanocrystals offset to the highest energy and the smallest volume.",contradiction
"As can be seen in Fig. 4, PnT increases with the decreasing of the nanocrystal size.",contradiction
"So, the calculation is carried out according to the method described by Liu et al. [166] (see Eq. (6)).",contradiction
"For example, for 14nm particle the cubic phase appears at a transition pressure of about 28GPa, but for 8nm particle the onset pressure is 29GPa.",contradiction
This phenomenon can be understood by realizing that the surface energy of cubic phase must be higher than that in the rutile phase.,contradiction
"The P?V data shown in Fig. 5 can be fitted by using the Birch?Murnaghan equation of state [166,173].(8)P=1.5B0[(V/V0)-7/3-(V/V0)-5/3]ž1+0.75B0?-4[(V/V0)-2/3-1]where B0 is the bulk modulus and B0? is the pressure derivative at zero pressure.",contradiction
It is pointed out that the size dependence in Eq. (7) arises both from the variation of P BT with size and surface energy of a nanocrystal.,contradiction
"The nanocrystals surface energy, in turn, is size dependent and gives rise to an effective pressure which modifies the applied pressure.",contradiction
"The relevant volume equations needed to calculate the first term in Eq. (7) for each phase are(9)Vlp(PnT,rlp)=V0,lp1+B0?B0,lpúp+2?lprlp1/B0? (10)Vhp(PnT,rhp)=V0,hp1+B0?B0,hpúp+2?hprhp1/B0?The second term in Eq. (7) is broken into two parts to obtain numerical values,(11)Ulp(PnT)-Uhp(PnT)=[Ulp(PnT)-Ulp(PBT)]-[Uhp(PnT)-Uhp(PBT)]+Ulp(PBT)-Uhp(PBT)where P BT is the bulk phase transition pressure.",contradiction
"By setting the chemical potential equal in Eq. (4), it can be shown that(12)Ulp(PBT)-Uhp(PBT)=-PBT[Vlp(PBT)-Vhp(PBT)]So, the last two terms in Eq. (11) can be calculated from the bulk SnO2 phase transition pressure and the volume change at transition in the bulk system.",contradiction
"The middle two terms in Eq. (11) can be calculated by integrating the Birch?Murnaghan equation of state, Eq. (8) and the Eq. (10) to generate the energy?volume curves as described before.",contradiction
In Fig. 6 the values of internal energy (U) versus the volume for the SnO2 polymorphs are shown.,contradiction
"On this plane, phase transition pressure are represented by straight lines of a given slope (?dU/dV = P BT) [174].",contradiction
"As pointed out by Gracia et al. [144], temperature plays an important role in the modifications of the structural parameters and in the localization of thermodynamic phase boundaries, thereby affecting the free energy of the several phases.",contradiction
The phase transitions in SnO2 attract special attention because SnO2 is analogous to silica (SiO2).,contradiction
"The discovery of rutile type structure from impact craters has led to several experimental investigations on the pressure and temperature stability relationship of these phases [150,151].",contradiction
"Thus analysis of the SnO2 analogs would make a significant contribution to the understanding of the transition to the different crystal structures of silica, especially the pyrite-type.",contradiction
The studies of pressure-induced phase transitions have been enabled by remarkable advances in techniques of crystallography that are carried out in situ under high-pressure conditions.,contradiction
"Earlier studies showed, that SnO2 undergoes a transition from rutile-type ? CaCl2-type? ? PbO2-type phase?fluorite-type cubic phase, transformation of cassiterite phase to the ?-PbO2-type structure and to a cubic structure at higher pressures identified as fluorite-type [152,153].",contradiction
The sequence of pressure driven transition of crystal structures goes like rutile-type?CaCl2-type? ?-PbO2-type?pyrite-type?ZrO2-type orthorhombic phase I?fluorite-type?cotunnite-type orthorhombic phase II [144?148].,contradiction

"During room-temperature compression of SnO2 to 49GPa, Haines et al. [154] first observed the rutile to CaCl2-type transformation near 12GPa.",contradiction
Authors also found out that the cubic phase was actually a modified-fluorite or pyrite-type structure of SnO2 and appeared above 21GPa at ambient temperature.,contradiction
"The finding was in good agreement with some of the other previous works [152,153,155].",contradiction
"It was also found that CaCl2? cubic transition was very slow at room temperature and in order to obtain maximum conversion, the sample was needed to heat for several hours at different pressures between 24 and 48GPa [156].",contradiction
Jiang et al. [157] reported that rutile-to-pyrite type transformation was sluggish with an onset transition-pressure (PBT) about 18GPa during the room-temperature (300K) compression.,contradiction
Ono et al. [158] contradicted this finding as rutile ? pyrite type transformation did not occur at 300K.,contradiction
The discrepancies are mainly attributed to the kinetic effect during phase transition at room temperature.,contradiction
The transition to ?-PbO2 type SnO2 was observed at 800K.,contradiction
"When the temperature was increased to 1100K, the intensity of the XRD peaks due to the ?-PbO2 type structure started to decrease and the peaks due to the pyrite type structure appeared.",contradiction
The XRD peaks due to the ?-PbO2 type structure eventually disappeared at 1300K.,contradiction
"A report showed that the transition boundary is represented by the linear equation, P (GPa)=16.7(ñ0.5)?0.0021(ñ0.0015)[T (K)?1000].",contradiction
"If SnO2 was not heated sufficiently within the pressure range of stability of the ?-PbO2 type phase, complete transformation would not occur.",contradiction
"As a consequence, direct transformation between the rutile-type and cubic phase would have been observed [152,153,155].",contradiction
"It was found that for obtaining ?-PbO2 type phase, the P BT of 12.6GPa was slightly lower than 14GPa [154,159].",contradiction
Ono et al. [158] divulged that a pressure of 30GPa and temperature of 1500K were required for the transformations to the ?-PbO2-type and pyrite-type phases.,contradiction
Kusaba et al. [160] reported a mechanism for the shock-induced phase transitions from rutile to fluorite-type and then to the ?-PbO2 type structures.,contradiction
Under similar conditions no transformation was observed for powdered samples.,contradiction
"It had been previously assumed that the cubic phase was fluorite structured [152,153].",contradiction
"However, the difference between the Pa3 ? structure, and the fluorite structure, Fm3 ?m, arises from a modification to the oxygen positions.",contradiction
In both the structures the cations form a fcc sublattice.,contradiction
"The anions in the fluorite structure lie on 8c sites with u =1/4, whereas in the Pa3 ? structure u is typically close to 0.345 [161].",contradiction
The difference in the anion positions results in the coordination polyhedron being a rhombohedron rather than a cube as in the Fm3 ?m structure.,contradiction
The cation coordination number is 6+2 for the Pa3 ? structure and 8 in the fluorite structure.,contradiction
"Thus, there is an increase in the coordination number from 6 in the CaCl2 type structure to 6+2 in the Pa3 ? structure.",contradiction
"Haines et al. [154] also worked on the mechanism of these phase transitions, and proposed a transformation pathways on the basis of group?subgroup relationships.",contradiction

"In the same report, it was pointed out that peaks from the CaCl2-type structure could be observed during room temperature compression at 50GPa.",contradiction
"Reliable lattice parameters of this Pnnm type can only be obtained at 28.8GPa owing to peak overlap with other high pressure phases, and also due to the reduced peak intensities.",contradiction
At 28.8GPa Pnnm phase coexists with the pyrite type cubic structure (Pa3 ?).,contradiction
Haines et al. [154] reported that there is little change in the six nearest neighbor distances between the CaCl2 type structure and the Pa3 ? at 15.5GPa.,contradiction
"Because the Pnnm symmetry is a subgroup of P4 2 /mnm, this first transition has a displacive character.",contradiction

These values are different from 0.203 to 0.223nm as is reported by Gracia et al. [144].,contradiction
As shown in Fig. 8 the orthorhombic cell exhibits a near doubling of the cell axis relative to the Pa3 ? phase.,contradiction

"However, the space group Pnam was reported to have distances ranging from 0.208 to 0.280nm at the equilibrium volume [144].",contradiction
The increase of mean Sn?O distance in Pnam compared to that of Pbca phase is due to the increase in the coordination number of Sn ions from seven to nine [156].,contradiction
"Authors also pointed out that in the ?-PbO2 structure, the cation with sixfold is centered in a highly distorted octahedron with three different Sn?O distances, 0.202, 0.205 and 0.209nm.",contradiction

These distances are shorter than the shortest metal?metal distances of 0.338nm in PbO2 and 0.330nm in SnO2.,contradiction
"This is contrary to the situation in the rutile-type structure where the second-nearest metal?oxygen distances of 0.375 and 0.359nm for PbO2 and SnO2, respectively [154].",contradiction
The cation coordination number is 6+2 for the Pa3 ? phase with six distances of 0.206nm and two of 0.293nm at the equilibrium value.,contradiction
"At 24GPa the transition occurs from rutile to fluorite-type (Fm3 ?m) structure, which is an eightfold oxygen coordinated structure with Sn?O distances of 0.216nm at the equilibrium value.",contradiction
"So, the increase of the Sn?O distances as compared to those of the Pbca and the Fm3 ?m phases is consistent with an increase of the coordination number of Sn ions from seven in Pbca to eight in Fm3 ?m.",contradiction
"In such cases, the difference between Pa3 ? and Fm3 ?m space groups arises from a modification of the oxygen positions.",contradiction
"In both structures the cation form a fcc sublattice, and the anions lie on 8c sites (u =0.25) in the Fm3 ?m structure, whereas in the Pa3 ?, optimized structure u =0.335.",contradiction
"This difference yields a cation coordination number, q =6+2 for the pyrite and 8 in the fluorite structure, respectively [144].",contradiction
"Earlier in the work of Haines et al. [154], it was observed that at 48GPa, oxygen coordinate u =0.347 is typical of the values observed for other Pa3 ? modified fluorite structures.",contradiction
"At this pressure, the cations are at 4a sites (0,0,0) and the anions are at 8c sites (u, u, u) in the Pa3 ? structure.",contradiction
With decreasing pressure the positions of the oxygen atoms change and coordinate u increases slightly.,contradiction
This has the effect of increasing the long Sn?O distances.,contradiction
"If u =0.38, the polyhedron becomes a regular octahedron and the pyrite structure is obtained.",contradiction

The a axis decreases smoothly.,contradiction
"Hazen et al. [177], on the other hand, concluded that in the rutile compounds (TiO2, SnO2, RuO2, GeO2 and MnF2) because of the greater compressibility of a, c/a increases significantly with pressure.",contradiction

It has been observed that the unique characteristics of nanomaterials can be systematically altered by compression.,contradiction

"The obtained value is comparable to indentation modulus reported in the literature for SnO2 nanobelts, for example, 150GPa and 60GPa [191,192].",contradiction
"These values are, however, well below the bulk single crystalline levels, confirming previous reports on reduced elastic modulus of nanowires with decreasing diameter [192,193].",contradiction
The size-dependence of Young?s modulus is attributed to the surface stress and surface elasticity [190].,contradiction
"There are numerous techniques to effectively measure the Young?s modulus of nanostructures, especially the nanowires and nanorods [191,194?196].",contradiction
"In one approach, the SnO2 nanobelts and nanowires were removed from the substrate and were loaded into diamond anvil cells (DACs) for subsequent characterization.",contradiction
A symmetric DAC with a pair of type-I diamonds and a 400?m culet (sample chamber position) was used.,contradiction
A hole with a diameter of 150?m was drilled on a stainless steel gasket and used as the sample chamber [197].,contradiction
The advantage of this method is that it completely nullifies the contribution of the substrates.,contradiction
"As mentioned by Barth et al. [190] nanowires are grown on substrate, but the exact epitaxial relationship at the interface is unclear [198].",contradiction
The stress and strain induced during the measurements are mainly localized near the base of the wire.,contradiction

"The differential ultrasonic force microscopy and atomic force acoustic microscopy exhibited excellent quantitative agreement yielding indentation moduli of 151ñ14 and 154ñ18GPa, respectively.",contradiction

DFT calculations showed that replacement of a single O atom by one N atom in the supercell corresponds to a 2.08% N concentration.,contradiction
"The replacement favors a spin-polarized state and its total energy is 439meV lower than that of non-spin-polarized states, indicating thereby that the ground state of N-doped SnO2 is stable [282].",contradiction

"However, calculation based on the thermodynamic ionization energies of these defects within the screened hybrid density functional, HSE06, to investigate the interaction of group acceptors (for example, In, Al, Ga, Li, N) with hydrogen impurities in this system indicates that an efficient p-type SnO2 is not achievable.",contradiction

"It is reported that the acceptor levels caused by NO were found to be ultra deep in the band gap, with P, As and Sb all found to act primarily as donor dopants on the Sn site [269].DFT calculation by Scanlon et al.

For F-doped SnO2 (FTO) the doping limit is caused by interstitial F defects.,contradiction
Many experimental studies on F-doped SnO2 attributed the increase in the conductivity with corresponding increase in F concentration in the oxide.,contradiction
"Xu et al. [200] conducted first principle calculation of electronic properties of FTO with 4.16 at.% of F, which was further extended by Velikokhatnyi et al. [293], where a systematic approach was employed to study the electronic structure of FTO over a range of F concentration varying from 0 to 66.6%.",contradiction
"As explained, the only distinction between the pure undoped and F-doped SnO2 is a shift in the Fermi level toward the conduction band, resulting in the appearance of the freely moving electrons.",contradiction
"It happens primarily because every F? ion introduced into the SnO2 lattice to substitute O2? ion binds only one electron from Sn atom, while releasing another free to move, transferring its charge through crystal.",contradiction
"As more and more F is introduced into SnO2 framework, more of the electronic states in the conduction band becomes occupied and thus, the whole band structure shifts down with respect to the Fermi level [293].",contradiction
"The observation revealed that at low concentration (up to ?16.7%), there is an increase in the effective amount of valence electrons corresponding to that of the actual doped materials.",contradiction

"The doping with As creates lattice defects, i.e. creates trap levels in the forbidden gap.",contradiction
These defects are responsible for the decrement in the resistivity and increment in the carrier concentration and mobility.,contradiction
"Above 0.15 wt%, the trap concentration dominates the concentration of donated electrons, which results in the increment of resistivity and decrement in the carrier concentration.",contradiction
"As mentioned before [270], upon doping, negative charges were introduced by the replacement of Sn atom in the lattice, which was compensated by the generation of VO+ sites.",contradiction
In SnO2 the energetic order of the defects is unambiguous with the vacancies more stable than the oxygen interstitial.,contradiction
"It can be explained by the close packing of the rutile structure, which makes the incorporation of large anion interstitial energetically expensive [300,301].",contradiction

The formation energy for oxygen or Sn vacancy becomes smaller compared to that (8.790+ E O eV for VO or 15.931+ E Sn for VSn) without Zn atom doping.,contradiction
This indicates that doping Zn atom in the SnO2 system is beneficial to form oxygen and Sn vacancies [317].,contradiction

DOS is a very useful quantity when one wants to look at optical spectra.,contradiction
"For a single electron confined in a box, the energy grows quadratically with no directional dependence in k-space.",contradiction

There are concomitantly bonding and antibonding O-O interactions.,contradiction
The upper part of the valence band is formed of antibonding Sn?O and O?O interactions.,contradiction

"A representative study of DOS by employing B3LYP exchange?correlation functional in the frame work of DFT shows good agreement between theory and experiment [144,179,248,249].",contradiction
"In particular, authors found a valence bandwidth of 8.1eV in good agreement with both experimental data (7.5eV reported in Ref. [345]) and with previous first-principles calculations (7.9eV and 8.8eV reported in Ref. [355]).",contradiction
"Many theoretical studies involved the hybrid functional and self-consistent GW approximation for quasiparticle band structures [63,212,236,242,243,356,357].",contradiction
Inspection of the projected DOS reveals that the group of bands between ?6 to 0eV derives mostly from O 2p and Sn 5p/Sn 4d states.,contradiction
The bands in the region between ?8.3 and ?6eV derive from a hybridization between O 2p and Sn 5s states.,contradiction
"Photoemission spectroscopy [63,225] showed a upper long-pair corresponding to the first peak, whereas the peak at ?4.5eV correspond to the shoulder of UPS, and finally the lower peak was found at ?8.5eV.",contradiction
These almost correspond to the calculated values reported by Robertson [225].,contradiction

Sn 5p states contribute to the valence band from ?6 to ?2eV.,contradiction
"In the upper part of the VB from ?5 to ?1eV, there is a slight contribution from Sn 4d states due to small amount of mixing between he Sn 4d states and O 2p states in the lower VB at ?21eV [345,349,359].",contradiction

"However, a measurement temperature above 100K, the exciton series is overspread by an exponential ?Urbach? tail attributed to transitions from a ?5- valence band (direct-allowed for E??c?) below the top ?3+ valence band.",contradiction
For E??c? the absorption edge is relatively broad having a shape relatively independent of temperature and no exciton is seen.,contradiction
The gradual onset of the E??c? is attributed to the fact that the ?3+??1+ is triply forbidden for E??c?.,contradiction

The mechanism of metal catalyst assisted vapor?liquid?solid (VLS) growth of nanowires was proposed by Wagner and Ellis [454] for the growth of silicon whiskers in 1964.,contradiction
It is perhaps one of the most efficient and widely used techniques to grow one dimensional nanostructures.,contradiction
"In this technique, the nanowire are grown on metal coated substrates [414,455].",contradiction
"The metal catalyst forms liquid alloy droplets at high temperatures, which absorbs the vapor components.",contradiction
The supersaturated alloy droplets drives the precipitation of the vapor component at the liquid?solid interface.,contradiction
"Thus in VLS, a vapor phase precursor is used to supersaturate a liquid catalyst from which a solid phase one-dimensional form is protruded.",contradiction
It has been shown that the aspect ratio of such one-dimensional structure can be achieved by tuning the size of metal particles that act as growth templates for the observed one-dimensional morphology.,contradiction
"It has been postulated that as the nanowire growth is controlled by diffusion along the liquid?solid interface, which results in the retention of the growth template (alloy particle) [454].",contradiction
"Given the fact that the structure and size of the tip remain constant during the nanowire growth, it is possible to fabricate nanowires of different diameters simply by applying metal catalysts of appropriate size [455].",contradiction
Most of the semiconductor nanowires grown by the VLS mechanism typically show preferential growth along a particular direction in order to minimize the surface energy [456].,contradiction

"As mentioned by Choi [445] and Lu et al. [458], in VLS there is a requirement of metal catalyst.",contradiction
Though not all metals can work.,contradiction
"For a catalyst to assist in the one-dimensional growth, it must form a liquid with a component of the solid phase.",contradiction
"Moreover, the solubility limit of the catalyst component in the liquid phase must be much higher than that in the solid phase.",contradiction
The equilibrium vapor pressure of the catalyst over the liquid alloy should be such that it would assist in the growth.,contradiction
"Thus generally, noble and transition metals work well with the VLS mechanism.",contradiction

"It was found by Wang et al. [413] the shape formations of nanowires and nanobelts of SnO2 are dependent of the droplet size, i.e., the wire is favorable when the droplet size is less than 90nm and the belt is favorable when the size of the droplet is more than 90nm.",contradiction
"The vapor?solid, vapor?liquid, and liquid?solid interfacial energies play a key role in the shape of the droplets.",contradiction
"Thermodynamically, the minimum radius of a stable liquid droplet under a certain degree of supersaturation is given by [459,460] (41)rm=2S?LVVLRNTln?where S?LV is the liquid?vapor interface energy, VL is the liquid molar volume, R N is the gas constant, T is the temperature and ? =(p ? p 0)/p 0 is the degree of supersaturation (here p and p 0 are respectively the actual ambient vapor pressure and the thermal equilibrium vapor pressure of the solid).",contradiction
"According to this equation, use of a smaller catalyst requires a higher degree of supersaturation.",contradiction
"However, the chemical potential of the component in the metal-alloy catalyst becomes high as the size of the catalyst decreases due to the Gibbs?Thomson effect(42)??=2S?rwhere ?? is the chemical potential difference of the component species in the liquid droplet, S ? is the surface energy and r is the radius of the curvature of the droplet.",contradiction
"Thus, obtaining one-dimensional nanostructure with smaller diameter is difficult due to the thermodynamic limitations associated with the use of a nanocatalyst.",contradiction
Zanotti et al. [461] observed that the liquid Sn phase is deeply correlated with the growth procedure.,contradiction
"Nanowires usually grow in a parallel plane, and grow at a short distance from the substrates and this distance is equivalent to a few times the mean free path of Sn atoms.",contradiction
"In this way, the closeness of the feeding liquid phase grants a transfer rate that is much higher than the one achieved on larger distances.",contradiction
"Thus, it was concluded that growth rate decreases with the increasing distance from the droplets and that the nanowires grow until the total consumption of liquid Sn.",contradiction
"It has been noticed that depending on the rate of growth of the nanowire, or ribbon the molar flux Jgrowth from the source is required to assure mass balance.",contradiction
"The mass flux can be calculated as(43)Jdiff=-D?[p(1)-p(0)]RTlwhere D ? is the diffusion coefficient, P Sn is the Sn vapor pressure and l is the distance from source to the condensation zone.",contradiction

"Once the nucleation takes place, the increase in volume is supported by the continuous supply of the reaction precursors extracted from saturated Au catalyst.",contradiction
The supply mechanism leads to the growth of the radius and height of the one-dimensional nanostructures.,contradiction
"The growth direction of the nanostructures depend on the substrate used [437,468,469].",contradiction

The nucleation and growth of SnO2 are attributed to the volatile SnO that is transported to the deposition zone by the carrier gas and then undergoes a decomposition reaction to induce the nucleation and growth of nanoribbons.,contradiction
Thermal evaporation process is very sensitive to the oxygen partial pressure [515].,contradiction
"Oxygen influences not only the volatility of the source materials and the stoichiometry of the vapor phase, but also influence the formation of products [496,516].",contradiction
"In general, a higher O2 partial pressure favors the growth of thicker nanowires and wider nanobelts.",contradiction
Author pointed out that the growth of SnO2 nanobelts normally requires a higher oxygen pressure than that required for the growth of nanowires.,contradiction

The nanowire formation takes place when PO2 increased from a minimum of 10?5 Pa and the growth rate was found maximum at pressure ?10?2 Pa.,contradiction
Thus the ability to supply adatoms into the metal catalyst plays a crucial role on VLS growth.,contradiction
"Fig. 44(b) shows that the size of the nanowire at the bottom increased with increasing PO2 while the tip size remained almost constant, indicating the presence of tapering.",contradiction

"The growth of the ring, spring, and spirals can be understood on the basis of polar surfaces of the rutile-structured SnO2.",contradiction
"If the charges on the {011} side surfaces are not compensated during the growth, the net dipole moment across the side surfaces and the surface energy tend to diverge with an increase of the nanobelt length.",contradiction
"On the other hand, the electrostatic energy due to the dipole moment can be minimized or neutralized when the nanobelt rolls up to form a ring or spiral structure.",contradiction
"The minimization of the total energy contributed by electrostatic polarization energy and elastic deformation energy determines the final morphology of the SnO2 nanobelt, resulting in the formation of the ring or multiply looped spiral.",contradiction
"Strangely, diskette like product can be obtained using either SnO or SnO2 powders under a higher pressure (500?600Torr) compared to ?3ž104 Pa used for the nanobelt system [496,518].",contradiction

"The zig-zag shaped structure with uniform width and angle, as shown in Fig. 47 , was synthesized by oxidizing Sn in the ambient temperature at 820?950øC [528?531].",contradiction
The structure is formed by changing the growth directions from [101] to [10 1 ?].,contradiction
"It is observed that because the difference in surface energy between {101} and {10 1 ?} is small, a slight fluctuation of the reaction conditions (partial pressures of the reactants, temperature, etc.) can cause the crystal to grow from {101} to {10 1 ?}.",contradiction

"k B is the Boltzmann constant, T absolute temperature, and ? is the supersaturation ratio determined by ?=p/p0, where p is the actual vapor pressure and p 0 the equilibrium vapor pressure corresponding to temperature T.",contradiction
"Thus, lower the surface energy, the larger is the nucleation probability.",contradiction
"On the other hand, an atom adsorbed on a low-energy surface has low binding energy and a high probability of desorption.",contradiction
Competition and coordination of the two processes are responsible for the formation of the low-index crystal planes enclosing the nanostructures.,contradiction

"If the expression ?G is positive, surface A is not thermodynamically stable, and the growth of facets B on A is feasible.",contradiction
"On the other hand, if it is negative, facets B cannot be formed [521].",contradiction
"In fact, as concluded by Lu et al. [533] Sn-terminated surface is not a polar surface, being electrostatically stable.",contradiction

Uniform and sharp SnO2 nanorod arrays can also grow on stainless steel sheets.,contradiction
It is pointed out that SnO2 nanorods grow better on smooth wafer substrates.,contradiction
"So, the growth contradicts the volcano-type growth mechanism, which stated that singular points at the surface of substrates act as growing centers and promote the growth of the oxide nanostructures due to the selective impingement of charged plasma species [536].",contradiction
"According to the proposed growth mechanism, SnO2 is deposited on the substrates first and forms a thin layer of SnO2 seed crystals serving as nucleation sites.",contradiction
"Then, the SnO2 seeds grow continuously along their preferential growth direction [110] to minimize the surface energy.",contradiction

"So, there have been numerous studies on SnO2 based gas sensors.",contradiction
"Reducing gases, for example, CO release electrons into the sensitive material upon interaction with the sensor surface and thus, decrease the resistance.",contradiction
The characteristics response of the gas sensor is attributable to the evolution of the concentration of various species present on the surface and the corresponding charge transfers including conductivity variations [779].,contradiction

"The successful detection behavior, of course depends on the ability of the surface to respond to the presence of adsorbed oxygen species.",contradiction
"The reduction and the oxidation of the sensing layer take place successively, corresponding to the formation and the annihilation of oxygen vacancies.",contradiction
"It has been observed that if no oxygen is supplied during the gas selection process, gases such as CO and H2O will reduce the sensing layer considerably, leading to a full consumption of the lattice oxygen atoms.",contradiction
"Finally, the detection process will stop because of the lack of reacting oxygen atoms [394,782].",contradiction

"This kind of charge polarization gives rise to a potential barrier between adjacent grains, whose height and width, which are a function of the concentration and nature of the anionic oxygen species, affect the nonlinear coefficient [387,790].",contradiction
Three types of chemisorption of O2 on the Sn site of the reduced SnO2 {110} surface correspond to exothermic processes.,contradiction
"The most thermodynamically favorable process is associated to the adsorption of O2 in the [110] direction, i.e. parallel to the Sn atomic row.",contradiction

The relationship between the particle size (r) and the width of the space-charge (depletion) layer (L) that is produced around the surface of the crystallites due to chemisorbed ions can lead to multiple scenarios [117].,contradiction
"When r ?2L, the conductivity of the whole structure depends on the inner mobile charge carriers and the electrical conductivity depends exponentially on the barrier height.",contradiction
"Interestingly, it is not sensitive to the charges acquired from surface reactions.",contradiction
"When r ?2L, the space-charge layer region around each neck forms a constricted conduction channel within each aggregate.",contradiction
"As a result, the conductivity depends on the grain boundaries as well as on the cross-section area of those channels.",contradiction
"Therefore, the particles are sensitive to the ambient gas composition.",contradiction
"When r ?2L, the space-charge layer dominates the whole grain and the crystallites are almost fully depleted of mobile charge carriers.",contradiction
The energy bands are nearly flat throughout the whole structure of the interconnected grains and there are no significant barriers for intercrystallite charge transport.,contradiction
The conductivity is essentially controlled by the intercrystallite conductivity.,contradiction
"Few charges acquired from surface reactions will cause large changes of conductivity of the whole structure, so the crystalline SnO2 becomes highly sensitive to ambient gas molecules when its particle size is small.",contradiction

"Upon adsorption on the SnO2 surface, an electron is donated from H2O molecule to the surface occurs.",contradiction
"The charge shift, however, is distributed equally among the atoms of the molecules.",contradiction
"Compared to the desorbed species, the H and O atoms lose 0.06 and 0.08 electrons, respectively.",contradiction
"It is observed that the reduction of the surface has only marginal effect on the stability of associatively adsorbed H2O, which is 0.05eV less stable than the most stable molecular configuration on the stoichiometric surface.",contradiction
"In contrast, dissociatively adsorbed H2O is stabilized by 0.24eV compared to the corresponding configuration on stoichiometric SnO2.",contradiction
The formation of additional H bonds leads to a change in the stability of molecular and dissociated H2O depending on the surface oxygen coverage.,contradiction
At low oxygen coverage (reduced surface) dissociated species were stabilized.,contradiction
"However, at high oxygen coverage (oxidized surface), associative adsorption is facilitated.",contradiction
"In a very detailed study, Santarossa et al. [825,833] observed that on a partially reduced {110} surface, the dissociation of H2O is fortified, resulting from an enhanced charge transfer from surface Sn-site to the adsorbates.",contradiction
This indicates that the reduction of the surface promotes its role as an electron donor.,contradiction
"At higher oxygen coverage, the electron transfer from the surface to adsorbates is reduced, leading to destabilization of dissociated H2O species.",contradiction
"In fact, the reaction between water vapor and the SnO2 surface causes remarkable changes in the oxide conductivity and consequently in the sensor response [829,834].",contradiction
"For SnO2, it has been shown that the addition of Ti results in a significant stabilization of the sensor response in the presence of varying water vapor content [835].",contradiction
"Carbon monoxide (CO) however, is captured by surface oxygen, especially by oxygen adsorbed on SnO2 and become carbonated species at room temperature.",contradiction
The interaction of SnO2 with CO results in the formation of Vo+ through the interaction of CO with the surface oxygen to form CO2 and neutral oxygen vacancies by the defect reaction CO+Oo?CO2+Vož.,contradiction
"This forms a paramagnetic defect through the defect reaction Vož? Vo++e?, producing an electron in the conduction band.",contradiction
Vo+ is supposed to transfer electrons onto Sn ions to form Vo++ through the reaction SnSnž + 2Vo+? SnSn?? + 2Vo++.,contradiction
"Shallow donor levels for Vo+/Vož and Vo++/Vo+ have been identified at 0.03 and 0.15eV below CBM, respectively [243].",contradiction
Ciriaco et al. [375] explains the changes of electronic structures induced by adsorption of CO molecules at different surface sites.,contradiction
It was inferred that the adsorption of CO molecules on SnO2 slabs does not inject electronic states into the band gap of the substrate and does not therefore induce sensible changes of the electrical properties.,contradiction
"However, CO adsorption brings change in the chemical potential of electrons, which is relevant to the sensor properties of SnO2 due to exchange of charge with electronic levels defects and impurities [383,836].",contradiction
CO can saturate the system in the same way as oxygen does.,contradiction
Adsorption of CO on Sn sites decreases the density of levels at the Fermi level and therefore the conductivity of the system.,contradiction
"The adsorption properties for deposited CO, O2 and water molecules have been considered by many authors [228,836,837].",contradiction
"Studies [836,838] however, show that the interaction of the deposited molecules with the thin atom underneath has a largely electrostatic character and is reinforced by substantial charge donation from CO to the cation.",contradiction
"For both CO and O2, the adsorption is generally featureless and the electronic configuration of the adsorbed grains has a scarce dependence on structural parameters, such as grain size, shape and the adsorption site.",contradiction
These properties are suggestive of the existence of multiple and long range interaction.,contradiction
"In the early 1989, Tamaki et al. [376] discussed the mechanism for CO adsorption, and the summary is given in Fig. 80 .",contradiction
"There is a limited number of adsorbed oxygen (O? or O2?), which is more reactive than the abundant lattice oxygen on the surface.",contradiction
CO molecules are captured on these oxygen species to form CO32 species [839].,contradiction
"However, the desorbed amount of CO2 after the CO exposure markedly decreased when the partially reduced SnO2 surface is used, and a very small degree of reduction caused a drastic decrease in CO2 desorption.",contradiction
"It is concluded that the CO molecules would be captured by the adsorbed oxygen than by lattice oxygen, and thus the amount of captured CO under a fixed condition would decrease drastically when the adsorbed oxygen has been eliminated by the partial reduction.",contradiction
"The adsorption of CO2 on a Sn4+ oxide surface takes place by physically adsorbed CO2, a carboxylate-type group, uncoordinated carbonate, a unindentate or bidentate carbonate group, an organic type carbonate group and a bicarbonate group.",contradiction
"Bicarbonate formation might be expected to occur with greater facility on more highly hydroxylated surfaces, i.e. those pretreated at low temperatures [839,840].",contradiction
Results indicate that water vapor which strongly adsorbs on SnO2 as surface hydroxyls interferes with CO adsorption significantly.,contradiction
It was observed that the desorption of CO2 in the presence of H2O is far smaller than that after exposure to CO alone [376].,contradiction
Nitric oxide (NO) is an electronegative species with an odd electron.,contradiction
"Interacting with metal site, it should take one electron and become negatively charged, NO? (nitrosyl anion).",contradiction
"Both NO and NO2 adsorbed on SnO2 surface in three different forms, depending on the oxidation state of SnO2: a nitrito type (Sn?O?NO) and two nitrosyl types (Sn?NO+, Sn?NO?) [841].",contradiction
"On heating, they desorbed almost exclusively as NO+ species, rather than NO?.",contradiction
"The nitrito type species, Sn?O?NO, can be formed naturally by the adsorption of NO2 on a surface cation.",contradiction
On heating the species desorbs exclusively as NO [376].,contradiction
"The adsorption of the NO molecule on the terminal oxygen atom, a part of the NO2 molecules adsorbed dissociatively as nitrosyl even on the oxidized surface.",contradiction
"On the reduced surface, the nitrito species are no longer formed, all the adsorbates are of the nitrosyl type, probably because of the existence of surface oxygen vacancies facilitated the dissociative adsorption of NO2.",contradiction
"Thus, the effect of NO2 is very similar to those of NO.",contradiction
"It is generally proposed [842] that the NO2 sensing at low operating temperatures, where we have obtained the highest responses is due to NO2 chemisorption and to the consequent charge depletion of the sensing materials following the reaction:(75)NO2(g)+e-?NO2-(ads) Calculations by Epifani et al. [843] showed that surface reduction influences both the energy exchange and the charge transfer between surface and analyte.",contradiction
SnO2 nanoribbons with exposed {10 1 ?} and {010} surfaces are considered highly effective for NO2 detection at room temperature [844].,contradiction
"The interaction of NO2 with the surface occurs through the oxygen vacancy sites, and that the presence of bridging oxygen vacancies strongly enhance the charge transfer from the surface of NO2.",contradiction
"Thus, NO2 tends to absorb onto SnO2 {110} in plane-O and bridging O?vacancy sites and increase the electrical resistance.",contradiction
Fig. 81 summarizes the above observations.,contradiction
"It was shown by DFT calculations that in the real frame, non-lattice oxygen adsorbed on SnO2 exhibit a more basic character than lattice bridging oxygens, and consequently, these oxygen play a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of NH3 on SnO2 with N2 and H2O as the main resulting products.",contradiction
Two different reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the interactions between NH3 and SnO2.,contradiction
"One led to the formation of water and NO, which is an endothermic reactions.",contradiction
"The other reaction mechanism forms N2 and H2O, the process is less endothermic.",contradiction
These values are mildly affected by the O2 binding energy.,contradiction
The calculation [845] showed N lone pair behaves as a donor to the surface.,contradiction
Adsorption then occurs onto the Sn-Lewis acid center.,contradiction
"Upon the adsorption step, ammonia dehydrogenation takes place.",contradiction
"On the stoichiometric {110} surface, lattice oxygen atoms can strip a hydrogen atom from the NH3 molecule, leading to the formation of a hydroxyl group and NH2 sitting on the Sn-Lewis acid center.",contradiction
"As the reaction to generate NH needs more energy (2eV), thus, once in neighboring positions, NH2 coupling to form hydrazine, N2H4 (0.75eV).",contradiction
"From adsorbed hydrazine compound, H abstraction by lattice oxygen takes place, leading to N2H3, N2H2 and N2H with the endothermicity of all these processes being less than 1.3eV.",contradiction
"In all cases, the H atoms leave the molecule end up as hydroxyl groups with the bridging oxygen atoms from the surface.",contradiction
The last step in this dehydrogenation correspond to N2H to N2.,contradiction
The thermodynamics of the most likely process in clean and reduced SnO2 (110) surface is shown in Table 7 .,contradiction
"However, for reduced (110) surface, when NH3 interacts with the partially O covered surface, the non-lattice oxygen atoms are much more efficient bases than non-lattice oxygen.",contradiction
"Then, the sensing path continues with the adsorption of ammonia molecules in neighboring Lewis Sn-sites.",contradiction
NH moieties on the surface can combine to other NHx fragments since diffusion of both NH2 and NH is low energy demanding.,contradiction
"Thus, NH3 interacts with SnO2 through the formation of nitrogen, and water and modifying the electric properties of the solid.",contradiction
"Shao et al. [845] showed that on the reduced surface NH3 molecules are attracted to the vacancy site as they concentrate a certain degree of electronic density, which repels the electron pair located at N.",contradiction
It was described that the O atoms in the non-lattice positions are more likely to attract the H atoms from neighboring NH3 molecules.,contradiction
"However, an overall water coverage partially blocks ammonia adsorption on SnO2 [846].",contradiction
"SnO2 sensors evoke particular interest for detecting inflammable gases and organic compounds, such as methanol (CH3OH) [847,848].",contradiction
"The like of ethylene (C2H4), on the other hand, offers problems because of its strong double bonds and hence, there are difficulties in dissociating it at modest temperatures.",contradiction
"At a given forward bias, the current increases on introduction of the C2H4.",contradiction
A possible mechanism for the current increase involves atomic hydrogen that is either decomposed from C2H4 in the gas phase or chemisorbed on the metal Schottky contacts then catalytically decomposed to release atomic hydrogen.,contradiction
The hydrogen can then diffuse rapidly through the metal electrodes and the underlying oxide to the interface where it forms a dipole layer and lowers the effective barrier height.,contradiction
Calatayud et al. [228] described a theoretical approach based on the Hartree?Fock pseudopotential method and DFT calculations using a hybrid combination of GGA to study adsorption and dissociation of methanol on the stable and stoichiometric {110} surface.,contradiction
"It was found that dissociation of methanol molecule via the heterolytic cleavage of the C?O bond is favored with the OH? and CH3- bind to the Sn5 atoms and bridging oxygen, Ob, respectively.",contradiction
"Viitala et al. [849] studied the DFT application for adsorption of three small hydrocarbon molecules, acetylene, ethylene and ethane.",contradiction
"On the reduced surface, the ethylene and acetylene lie symmetrically on top of the Sn atom they rotate in the plane of the surface.",contradiction
"Ethane, however, does not lie flat on the surface, but is tilted considerably, bringing the hydrogen closer to the Sn atoms, suggesting that ethane is physisorbed on the surface, while unsaturated molecules are probably adsorbed with combined mechanism of physisorption and chemisorption [386].",contradiction
The adsorption energies and SnO2 surface are given in Table 8 .,contradiction
"In case of acetylene, the adsorption energy describes clear chemisorption.",contradiction
"Normally, the ethanol vapor is adsorbed on the surface of thermally activated SnO2 as [850] (76)O2(gas)+e-?O2-(adsorb)the oxygen molecules are dissociated into oxygen ion with singly or doubly negative electric charges by attracting an electron from the conduction band of SnO2 as(77)12O2+e-?koxyOads- (78)12O2+2e-?koxyOads2-The oxygen ions on the surface of SnO2 are active with the ethanol molecule and give up the electrons from the surface back to the conduction band of SnO2 semiconductor.",contradiction
"The chemical reaction between ethanol molecule and oxygen ions is expressed as(79)CH3CH2OHads+Oads-?kEthC2H4O+H2O+1e- (80)or,CH3CH2OHads+Oads2-?kEthC2H4O+H2O+2e- These cause an increase in the conductivity and thus, the decreasing the resistance of the sensor.",contradiction
"For formaldehyde and acetone, the reactions go in similar pattern.",contradiction
"The oxygen molecules are ionosorbed because they pick up the local electronic charge associated with these reduced Sn2+ ions, which lead to the reaction of detection of organic compounds.",contradiction
"One, two and three dimensional SnO2 nanostructures, such as nanowire, nanobelt, nanoribbon, nanorod, dense and hollow spheres, sheets and mesoporous structure have been routinely and consistently employed for gas sensing applications.",contradiction
Hwang et al. [851] details the gas sensing properties of SnO2 nanowires for NO2 detection.,contradiction
The diameters of the nanowires ranged from 50 to 100nm.,contradiction
"At a NO2 concentration of 20ppm, a sensitivity of 300, response time of 100s, and a recovery time of 200s were observed.",contradiction
"Previously, it was found that SnO2 nanobelt gas sensors can detect 3ppm of NOx at room temperature [819].",contradiction
It is also observed that reduction in the size of the SnO2 nanowires gives rise to an increase in the value of the sensitivity due to a considerable change in the depletion layer.,contradiction
"When the depletion layer is greater than or equal to the diameter of the nanowires, the value of the sensitivity dramatically increases [800,819,852].",contradiction
The gas sensing mechanism is mainly determined by the adsorption and desorption of gas molecules on the surface of the nanowires.,contradiction
SnO2 nanowires exposed to NOx increase the value of resistance due to capture of conduction band electrons.,contradiction
These captive electrons give rise to bending of the energy band at the interface between the semiconductor and the incident gas.,contradiction
Herna?ndez-Rami?rez et al. [853] analyzed a two- and four probe measurement of individual nanowire for detecting low concentration (5ppm) CO.,contradiction
"The nanowire configuration shown in Fig. 82 was fabricated following a bottom up approach, in which, an individual SnO2 nanowire contacted with Pt strips using focused ion beam (FIB).",contradiction
"It was also concluded that at room temperature measurement, contact resistance contribution is more than the nanowire resistance.",contradiction
The main part of the measured contact resistance originated in the PtSnO2?nanowire junction.,contradiction
Tischner et al. [559] described the performance of single crystalline SnO2 nanowire for CO and CH4 sensing in the low ppm (3ppm) regime.,contradiction
Wan et al. [854] reported that undoped SnO2 nanowire show very poor transistor behavior in air due to their high resistivity and formation of Schottky contacts.,contradiction
"The electrical performance of these SnO2 nanowires, however, can be significantly improved by Sb doping.",contradiction
Data from the Nyquist plot of the SnO2 nanowire under both the 1% O2 and the N2 environments revealed that the conductance in the semiconducting nanowire increases with increasing temperature.,contradiction
"In the oxygen-rich environment, the width of the Schottky barriers in the SnO2 nanowire becomes wider since the oxygen molecules absorbed on the surface of the nanowire can trap the electrons in the vicinity of the surface.",contradiction
"As a result, the impedance of the nanowire becomes higher under 1% O2 compared with that in N2 [855].",contradiction
As-grown crystalline SnO2 nanowire obtained through CVD was assembled on an oxidized Si substrate with patterned Au/Ti microelectrode to detect the ammonia (NH3).,contradiction
Contacts to the nanowires were then patterned by using FIB lithography.,contradiction
The interaction mechanism of NH3 and SnO2 is a thermally activated process with a maximum response between 215 and 250øC.,contradiction
"In this temperature range, pulses from 500ppb to hundreds of ppm were detected [845,856].",contradiction
The results obtained by Shao et al. [845] is shown in Fig. 83 .,contradiction
The authors also studied the role of water in the sensing performance of SnO2 nanowire.,contradiction
It is observed that the H2O?SnO2 interactions interfere with the sensing response of this metal oxide toward typical NH3 traces.,contradiction
"Actually, NH3 signal was hugely suppressed in humid conditions without any significant change in the final response for different water concentrations [845].",contradiction
"In a recent report, the methanol sensing study on as-grown SnO2 nanowire was performed by temperature and concentration modulation to find the optimum operating temperature (T opt) of around 450øC [857].",contradiction
"Nanowires were grown uniformly throughout the Au/Si substrate and were vertical with respect to the substrate, with a length and diameter of 2?2.5?m and 30?80nm, respectively.",contradiction
"The report, however, did not provide the detail nanowire circuitry configuration employed to study the gas detection.",contradiction
Kolmakov et al. [821] showed enhanced gas sensing of single SnO2 nanowires configured as resistive elements by surface decoration with pd nanoparticles.,contradiction
"A massive improvement in sensitivity toward oxygen and hydrogen was attributed to the enhanced catalytic dissociation of the molecular adsorbate on the Pd nanoparticle surfaces [119,550].",contradiction
"This process greatly increases both the quantity of oxygen that can repopulate vacancies on the SnO2 surface and the rate at which this repopulation occurs, resulting in a greater (and faster) degree of electron withdrawal from the SnO2 (and at a lower temperature) than for the pristine metal oxide nanowire.",contradiction
Similar results were recently obtained by Jang et al. [858] with Pt catalyst for hydrogen sensing and Jin et al. [859] with Au catalyst for ethanol sensing.,contradiction
Both the response and recovery times of the SnO2 nanobelts were decreased by Au-functionalization regardless of the ethanol concentration.,contradiction
The functionalized nanobelt sensor was superior to the bare SnO2 nanobelt sensor in terms of both response and rate of sensing.,contradiction
The pre-adsorption of water and humidity affect the gas sensing behavior of SnO2 nanostructures as reported by Li et al. [860].,contradiction
"In contrast to the report by Herna?ndez-Rami?rez et al. [853], which described a negative effect of humidity (H2O) on CO detection, current increased linearly for SnO2 single crystal nanobelt with relative humidity in air and with water concentration in vacuum.",contradiction
The current response to ethanol gas increased substantially when water was pre-adsorbed.,contradiction
"However, no change was found without water pre-adsorption.",contradiction
This interesting behavior is ascribed to competition between the H2O and C2H5OH molecules trying to adsorb on oxygen sites at the SnO2 surface.,contradiction
"Dissociated water acts as the surface conduction channel resulting in better conductivity, while ethanol is physisorbed without water pre-adsorption.",contradiction
In a related report the performance of SnO2 nanowire based FET as highly sensitive humidity sensor was analyzed [861].,contradiction
A single SnO2 nanowire of 250nm in diameter was placed between two Au electrodes of 100nm thickness and deposited with Pt by focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy as the top electrode to improve contact.,contradiction
"Both static and dynamic testing revealed that the humidity sensor has a fast response and high sensitivity to relative humidity (RH) changes in air, and at the same time, its response sensitivity is linear with RH in air.",contradiction
CO and H2 detection with flower like morphology was reported by Firooz [862] and Jiang et al. [746].,contradiction
Maximum sensitivities occur at about 400øC.,contradiction
"It was described that flower-like SnO2 consists of numerous nanoparticles joined together into flower-like structure, resulting in much more active exposed sites for gas chemisorptions.",contradiction
"Thus, the realization of a high sensitivity of flower-like morphology may be explained in terms of rapid gas diffusion onto the entire sensing surface due to the specific morphology of this material.",contradiction
"In a separate work [863], these flower shaped nanostructures are employed to detect 50?1000ppm CO were studied at 275øC.",contradiction
"Flower, cube and prism shaped morphologies were obtained via a surfactant (CTAB: SDS) assisted aqueous solution route with flower shaped nanostructure registering the highest response for both CO and ethanol.",contradiction
A highly sensitive and fast responding CO sensor was fabricated from a sheet-like SnO2 [864].,contradiction
"The sensor response of SnO2 nanosheets to 10ppm CO was enhanced up to 2.34, and the 90% sensor response time could be reduced to 6s, which are significantly higher and shorter than those of SnO2 powders (1.57 and 88s), respectively.",contradiction
The realization of both high sensitivity and rapid response were attributed to the rapid gas diffusion onto the entire sensing surface due to the less-agglomerated and very thin structure of SnO2 nanosheets.,contradiction
"In another such report, Kim et al. [865] pointed out that SnO2 hierarchical spheres showed both the ultra-fast response (?1s) and high sensitivity to 50ppm ethanol.",contradiction
"Two different gas sensors were fabricated using the nano-porous hierarchical and dense SnO2 spheres, and their dynamic sensing characteristics at 400øC were examined.",contradiction
"The R a/R g values of the hierarchical spheres to 10?50ppm ethanol ranged from 7.7 to 33.1, while those of the dense spheres ranged from 4.6 to 10.1. The difference was attributed to the superior gas diffusivity in the nanoporous assembly of hierarchical sphere to dense sphere.",contradiction
"Polypyrrole coated hollow SnO2 spheres [866] however registered highly sensitive features to detect ammonia (NH3) gas at room temperature, which pure SnO2 sphere failed to detect.",contradiction
"SnO2 hollow spheres synthesized through a water-in-oil microemulsion method, show a good response to CO in the concentration range of 50?300ppm [867].",contradiction
"The loose and porous structure provides the hybrids with a higher surface area to volume ratio, which enormously contributes to the gas diffusion process.",contradiction
Xu et al. [742] compared the sensitivities of two-dimensional mesoporous thin films and nanowires (diameter 1.5?4.5nm) for ethanol detection.,contradiction
"It was noticed (Fig. 84 ) that SnO2 quantum dots smooth film without porous structures, the gas sensitivity was low.",contradiction
The SnO2 ultrathin nanowire smooth film showed gas sensitivity that was a factor of 2 higher than the smooth film.,contradiction
"Interestingly, the sensitivity of the porous film prepared from the SnO2 quantum dots was nearly five times higher than that of the counterpart smooth film.",contradiction
"Lingmin et al. [868] performed the gas sensing experiment to examine the comparative responses of the SnO2 nanowire, nanorod and nanocluster to ethanol, H2, CO and CH4.",contradiction
"It was concluded that SnO2 nanowires-based sensor exhibited very low response to H2, CO, especially to CH4, but good response to ethanol.",contradiction
"This selectivity was ascribed to the higher surface-to-volume ratio, as well as superior thermal stability of the nanowires.",contradiction
"In fact several reports pointed out to the viability of the nanowires, nanotubes [728,731] or nanostructures [867,869] with higher surface-to-volume ratio and porous morphology with greater gas diffusion probability as superior sensing materials [645,706,744,870?873].",contradiction
"Xi et al. [735] pointed out that compared with the ethanol gas-sensing properties of SnO2 nanorods (31.4?300ppm) [874], hollow spheres (7.5?50ppm) [429], and nanotubes (8?20ppm) [731], reported by others, those of the as-synthesized ultrathin SnO2 nanorods are superior.",contradiction
"The relationship of the surface to volume ratio with the gas sensitivity is described as [850,868] (81)S?=?tkEth?0Cg?n0VmVs+1where ?t is a time constant, n 0 is the electron concentration of sensor at an operating temperature in the air atmosphere, k Eth is the reaction rate constant, C g is the gas concentration, ?0 is a number of oxygen ion per unit area, ? is a ratio of surface area per volume of material (V m) and V s is the system volume.",contradiction
"Thus, S? has a linear relationship with (V m/Vs) k Eth and having a slope of ??0Cg?/n0.",contradiction
"Thus, for nanostructures with higher diffusivity paths for target gases and improved effective contact surface-to-volume ratio register superior sensitivity to gas detection.",contradiction
"An extension of the above Eq. (81) for cylindrical geometry, which is the basic shape in one-dimension, can be considered in space-charge model.",contradiction
"At an operating temperature, the ion adsorbed by attaching an electron on the surface of the cylinder.",contradiction
"Therefore, the depletion layer is formed on the surface of cylinder with a thickness of L, and then a size of conductive channel is reduced along the radial direction.",contradiction
"The carrier concentration can be written as(82)n?=n0?(D-2L)2?D2where n 0 is the carrier concentration of intrinsic material, n? represents carrier concentration of the Debye length, and D is diameter of the cylinder.",contradiction
"Thus, Eq. (81) for a cylindrical shaped nanostructure can be written as(83)S?=?tkEth?0Cg?n0VmVsD2Cg(D-2L)2+1When a cylindrical diameter decreases down to the order of nanometer and is comparable to Debye length (D ?2L), the depletion layer has strong effect and the sensor response is strongly dependent on a cylindrical diameter.",contradiction
"Thus, Eq. (83) can be used to explain sensor response of all structural sizes from nanometer to bulk and can be considered as a general form of sensor response.",contradiction
A record on the comparative gas response for different one-dimensional nanostructures on the basis of earlier experimental works is compiled in Table 9 .,contradiction
"Otherwise for hierarchical (such as urchin, flower, nanosheets, etc.) and spherical nanostructure (dense or hollow), the key parameters to determine the gas sensing characteristics of hollow oxide structure are the thickness, gas permeability, and surface morphology of the shell layer.",contradiction
"In case of dense shells, the gas sensing occurs only near the surface region of hollow sphere, while the inner part largely remains inactive.",contradiction
"However, if the shell is thin or microporous, then entire shell participates in the gas sensing.",contradiction
"For thin and long nanowires, the surface area of urchin like microsphere is inversely proportional to the nanowire diameter.",contradiction
"Thus, thinner nanowire assist in improving the gas sensitivity by increasing the interacting surface area with gas.",contradiction
It is observed that the resistance of the primary particles near the surface of the secondary particles is affected by the exposure to reducing gases and the gas response becomes slow.,contradiction
"In contrast, the gas diffusion length of hierarchical nanostructures and hollow spheres with porous surface helps in effective gas diffusion.",contradiction
"So, the gas response is very fast and the structure becomes highly conducting state when exposed to the reducing gas in n-type semiconductor gas sensors [700].",contradiction
"In recent times, researchers proposed highly effective and developed sensors based on networked SnO2 nanowires with higher selectivity and stability.",contradiction
"It is to be noted that though sensor based on single or multiple nanowire is known for fast detection and high sensitivity, yet its practical application still has considerable challenges.",contradiction
This is because fabrication of chemical sensors based on a single nanowire usually requires an extremely careful lithography process.,contradiction
The inconsistency in the repeatability because the current change in a single nanowire during the interaction process of gaseous species on its surface is infinitesimal.,contradiction
The probable solution is to fabricate sensors arrays consisting of vertical and random nanowires [881].,contradiction
"The vertical nanowires can be obtained by the methods described earlier [549,882].",contradiction
"As shown schematically in Fig. 85 , prior to growing SnO2 nanowires, patterned-inter digital electrodes (PIEs) were made on SiO2-grown Si (100) substrates using a conventional photolithographic process.",contradiction
"This includes depositing a photoresist (PR) layer by a spinning method, exposing the PR layer to ultraviolet light using a photomask of an interdigital electrode pattern, removing the exposed area and depositing trilayers of Au (3nm)/Pt (100nm)/Ni (50nm) in sequence by a sputtering method, and finally removing the remaining PR layer by a lift-off process.",contradiction
"In particular, to improve the adhesion between the SiO2 and the Pt layers, a 50-nm-Ni layer was inserted between them.",contradiction
Networked SnO2 nanowires were synthesized by the well known VLS growth method [882].,contradiction
The top and bottom panel of Fig. 86 show the patterned sensors along with the sensor response.,contradiction
"The nanowires grew on the patterned substrates were plasma treated, and the response of these nanowires on NO2 detection is shown.",contradiction
"It is obvious that the NO2 detection was greatly enhanced by the plasma treatment, from a response of 40 for the pristine SnO2 nanowires to 420 for the 180-s-plasma treated SnO2 nanowires.",contradiction
"On the right of the bottom panel, the response curves of the SnO2 nanowire gas sensor to different concentrations of hydrogen at different operating temperatures in the range of 200 to 300øC, with an air purge between the hydrogen cycles, at a fixed dc voltage of 5V are shown.",contradiction
The hydrogen gas is diluted with air to concentrations of 10?1000ppm.,contradiction

The phase transition temperature is ?68øC [2].,contradiction
"The crystal will change from the M 1 structure to the R structure with the temperature increase, associated with electrical conductivity jumps by several orders of magnitude [3,4].",contradiction
"Moreover, it is found that VO2 will change from a monoclinic phase (space group P21/c, M 1) to a monoclinic phase (space group C2/m, M 2) under strain or doping, accompanied with a significant increase of resistance and a strong piezoresistive effect [5].",contradiction
The transition between these phases is reversible [6].,contradiction

"It is well known that the knowledge of the elastic properties of VO2 is highly desired for VO2 integration in nano and thin-film electronic devices, for example, the strain energy estimation and stress analysis in thin-film devices [9].",contradiction
"Furthermore, the elastic properties, such as elastic constants c ij, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and elastic anisotropy characteristic, are the basis for selecting mechanical materials and the commonly used parameters in engineering design [10?12].",contradiction
"However, only the Young's modulus of VO2 has been measured based on the stress?strain data [10], and the first-principles bulk modulus of the R phase has been predicted in terms of the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) [12].",contradiction
"Until now no systematic studies have been done on the elastic properties of the R phase, M 1 phase and M 2 phase VO2, which inhibit the fundamental understanding and fabrication of VO2.",contradiction
The lack of knowledge of the elastic properties in VO2 therefore inspires the present research.,contradiction
"In this work, we systematically study the elastic properties of the R phase, M 1 phase and M 2 phase VO2, including single-crystal elastic constants c ij's, polycrystalline bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and elastic anisotropy characteristic, and discuss the pressure dependence of c ij's.",contradiction

"The energy?volume curves and the pressure?volume curves of the R phase, M 1 phase and M 2 phase VO2 are shown in Fig. 1 .",contradiction
The total energies of these phases are very close.,contradiction
"For instance, the total energy of the M 2 phase is just ?0.5meV/atom higher than those of the R phase and M 1 phase, suggesting that a small perturbation from outside may make the phase transition to occur among them.",contradiction
This is consistent with the well-known experimental report of metal insulator transition (MIT) [17] and monoclinic?monoclinic (M 1?M 2) phase transition [5].,contradiction
"For example, Sedlmayr et al. [5] reported that a strain of about 0.5?1% can make the M 1 phase to transit to the M 2 phase and this process is reversible.",contradiction
"In addition, we also find that the formation energies (or cohesive energies) of the R phase, M 1 phase and M 2 phase VO2 are almost the same, which imply that the energy of these phases is very close.",contradiction
It is in agreement with the calculation results shown in Fig. 1(a).,contradiction
"The energy?volume data points shown in Fig. 1 are fitted by the fourth-order Birch?Murnaghan equation of state (EoS) [18] as shown in(3)E(V)=a+bV?2/3+cV?4/3+dV?6/3,where E is the energy, V is the volume, and a, b, c and d are the fitting parameters.",contradiction

"The predicted V 0's of the R phase, M 1 phase and M 2 phase are slightly smaller than the measured values.",contradiction
"V0(M1)<V0(M2), which may be due to the fact that the M 2 phase is an antiferromagnetic state, while the M 1 phase is a nonmagnetic state.",contradiction
This is because magnetic materials often have a larger volume than the nonmagnetic one when they are in the same Bravais lattice [19].,contradiction
"For the R phase, the presently predicted value is 243GPa, which is a little smaller than the previous reported value of 248.5GPa [12].",contradiction
This difference probably arises from the fact that the energy?volume points used in the EoS fittings are not in the same elastic region.,contradiction
It is worth noting that in the calculations we do not consider the influences of temperature and zero-point vibration energy.,contradiction
"In general, this will reduce the bulk modulus [19].",contradiction

"The c ij's of different phases differ from each other, suggesting that their elastic anisotropy will be different.",contradiction
The predicted c ij's as a function of volume are also shown in Fig. 2 .,contradiction
"The R phase, M 1 phase and M 2 phase VO2 become mechanically unstable with decreasing volume (or increasing pressure), due to the fact that strain energy must be positive, i.e., the c ij matrix should satisfy the Born stability criteria [20].",contradiction
"For a tetragonal rutile structure, the Born stability criteria are [21] (4)c11>0,c33>0,c44>0,c66>0, (5)c11?c12>0, (6)c11+c33?2c13>0, (7)2(c11+c12)+c33+4c13>0.For a monoclinic structure, the Born stability criteria are [21] (8)c11>0,c22>0,c33>0,c44>0,c55>0,c66>0, (9)c11+c22+c33+2(c12+c13+c23)>0, (10)c33c55?c352>0, (11)c44c66?c462>0, (12)c22+c33?2c23>0, (13)c22(c33c55?c352)+2c23c25c35?c232c55?c252c33>0, (14)2[c15c25(c33c12?c13c23)+c15c35(c22c13?c12c23)+c25c35(c11c23?c12c13)]?[c152(c22c33?c232)+c252(c11c33?c132)+c352(c11c22?c122)]+c55g>0, (15)g=c11c22c33?c11c232?c22c132?c33c122+2c12c13c23.According to Eq. (10), the M 1 phase (Fig. 2b) is predicted to be mechanically unstable when its volume is larger than 10.27A?3/atom (P??12GPa), due to the decrease of c 33 and c 55 and the increase of c 35.",contradiction
"This instability may imply a monoclinic?monoclinic phase transition, such as the report of the M 1 phase changing into the M 2 phase under uniaxial tension [5].",contradiction
"When V(M1)<9.17 A?3/atom (P?13GPa), c 11 (c 33) suddenly decreases and c25?0, suggesting a possible phase change.",contradiction
"For example, the semiconductor state M 1 phase changes to be the metal state R phase under compression [6].",contradiction
"We also found similar phenomena in the R phase (Fig. 2a) and the M 2 phase (Fig. 2c): according to Eqs. (5) and (14), the R phase and the M 2 phase are predicted to be elastically unstable when their volumes are smaller than 9.28A?3/atom (P?13GPa).",contradiction
This instability could hint at a phase transition achieved at high pressure.,contradiction
"When V>11.56 A?3/atom (P??25GPa), c 44(M 2) ?0, the M 2 phase is predicted to be mechanically unstable based on Eq. (8), while c11(R)?0, which also implies a possible phase transition.",contradiction

"According to the Voit?Reuss?Hill method [22], the calculated moduli are shown in Table 2 .",contradiction
"The bulk moduli obtained from c ij's are larger than the ones from EoS fittings by 5?9%, since (i) all the freedoms of crystal are allowed to relax in the EoS fittings, while the cell shape is fixed in the determination of c ij's and (ii) the data of energy vs volume used in the EoS fittings are not in the complete elastic region, unlike the determinations of c ij's [19].",contradiction
"Push [23] proposed a formula, i.e., B/G, to judge a metal's malleability and brittleness in 1954.",contradiction
"The quotient, B/G, is an indication of the extent of the plastic range for a pure metal, so that a high value of B/G is associated with malleability and a low value with brittleness.",contradiction
"Here we also calculated the values of B/G for VO2 to estimate the brittleness of VO2, as shown in Table 2.",contradiction
"The predicted B/G=2.14?2.22, indicating that the brittleness of VO2 is slightly larger than the calcium in face centered cubic structure (B/G=2.33) [23], while it is smaller than the cadmium in hexagonal close packed structure (B/G=2.05) [23].",contradiction
"Additionally, the predicted Young's moduli of the M 1 and M 2 phases are 305GPa and 308GPa, respectively, as shown in Table 2.",contradiction
"However, Guo et al. [10] reported that the Young's moduli of the M 1 and M 2 structures VO2 are 128ñ10 and 156ñ10GPa, respectively, which are smaller than our predictions.",contradiction
"Until now, we still cannot find out the reason for it.",contradiction
Further experimental as well as theoretical investigations are needed to find out the reason.,contradiction
"Interestingly, both of our predictions and the results of Guo et al. show that the Young's modulus of the M 2 phase is larger than that of the M 1 phase.",contradiction
"This implies that the M 2 phase is harder than the M 1 phase, i.e., the bulk modulus and the shear modulus of the M 2 phase are larger than that of the M 1 phase, which is compatible with our results (the small difference in B H among them may be caused by the numerical errors and can be neglected).",contradiction
The reason for the harder M 2 phase may originate from the magnetism of the M 2 phase (the M 1 phase is a nonmagnetic structure) [1].,contradiction
"For the R phase, its bulk modulus and shear modulus are close to the M 2 phase, demonstrating that the rigidities of them are approximative.",contradiction
"In addition, we can also estimate the elastic anisotropy characteristics of VO2 based on the predicted c ij's.",contradiction
"The elastic anisotropy ratio of the R phase A(R)=3.07, based on the definition of A=2c44/(c11?c12)?(c[001]/c[110])2 , which is consistent with the measured value (A(R)=2.7) reported by Maurer et al. [24].",contradiction
"The predicted A(M 1) (2.13) is smaller than A(R), which is also in agreement with the results of Maurer et al. [24].",contradiction
"But Maurer et al. [24] deduced that the elastic anisotropy of M 1 phase disappears in terms of the predicted A (M 1), which is not comprehensive.",contradiction
"Since from the definition of A, we know that it has only compared the elastic nature of [001] direction with [110] direction, and has not included the other directions.",contradiction
"For a more comprehensive estimate of VO2 elastic anisotropy, we adopt the anisotropy indexes of bulk modulus and shear modulus (A B and A G) proposed by Chung and Buessen [25], and the universal elastic anisotropy index A U developed by Ostioja-Starzewski [26] for crystal with any symmetry, to estimate the anisotropic characteristic of the system.",contradiction
"They are(16)AB=(BV?BR)/(BV+BR), (17)AG=(GV?GR)/(GV+GR), (18)AU=5GV/GR+BV/BR?6.where AB=AG=0 represents the elastic isotropic, and AB=AG=1 represents the maximum elastic anisotropy.",contradiction
"Eq. (18) indicates that the further the value of A U from 0, the larger the anisotropy of material.",contradiction
For isotropy materials AU=0.,contradiction
"As can be seen in Table 1, AU(M2)>AU(M1)>AU(R), indicating that the M 2 phase has the maximum elastic anisotropy among the three phases, followed by the M 1 phase, and then the R phase.",contradiction
"The values of A U for the R phase, M 1 phase and M 2 phase VO2 are close to that of hexagonal Zn (?1.82) and trigonal calcite (?2.0) [26], indicating a similar elastic anisotropy property to hexagonal Zn and trigonal calcite.",contradiction
"We have systematically studied the elastic properties of VO2 with a rutile (R) structure and monoclinic (M 1, M 2) structure within the GGA approach.",contradiction
"Additionally, the elastic properties of polycrystalline aggregates (bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and elastic anisotropy) are also determined and compared with experiments and theoretical predictions.",contradiction
"It is found that the total energies of the R, M 1 and M 2 phases are very close, indicating that it is easy to transit among them under a perturbation.",contradiction
"Moreover, the R, M 1 and M 2 phases VO2 are predicted to be mechanically unstable with a decreasing volume (or increasing pressure), due to the fact that the strain energy must be positive.",contradiction
"Additionally, the R and M 2 phases of VO2 are predicted to be harder than the M 1 phase, indicated by their larger bulk moduli and shear moduli.",contradiction
The elastic anisotropy of M 2 phase is found to be larger than the M 1 phase and the R phase.,contradiction
The presently predicted elastic properties of VO2 are useful for the material design and the prediction of material capability.,contradiction
"Despite much progress in ab initio electronic structure-based calculations of solid state properties, results of effective pair-potential studies still hold merit because of their simplicity as well as considerably less demand on computational efforts and resources.",contradiction
"For metals, such potentials are useful because of the associated ease of implementation and for developing an understanding of trends within certain groups, such as transition and noble metals, and their alloys.",contradiction
"In addition, they provide a relatively easy way to study systems without periodicity such as clusters, liquids and amorphous solids, and systems with broken periodicity such as surfaces and interfaces.",contradiction
"Of course, pair-potential models have some well-known deficiencies.",contradiction
"For example, they are unable to distinguish between vacancy formation and cohesive energies [1], and yield identical values for the elastic constants C 12 and C 44 for cubic lattices [2].",contradiction
"Attempts to go beyond pair potentials, apart from embarking on full ab initio electronic structure-based calculations [3], involve an embedded atom model (EAM) [4] and similar methods [5,6], where the total energy of the static solid is expressed as a sum of pair-potentials plus an empirical volume/density-dependent term or an electronic band(bond) energy term [7].",contradiction
"However, in terms of their implementation these are still empirical or at best semi-empirical methods, and the issue of fitting parameters of such schemes to some chosen reference state properties still remains to be addressed.",contradiction
"In this work we consider two groups of pair-potentials and study their effectiveness in describing the solid state properties and the liquid structure of noble metals Cu, Ag and Au.",contradiction
"One group of potentials is the Morse potential with parameters fitted to solid state properties: cohesive (sublimation) or vacancy formation energies, isothermal bulk modulus and equilibrium lattice parameter [8?10].",contradiction
The other set of potentials used is one that was developed by Erkoc? [11].,contradiction
"The starting point in developing this set of potentials was not the solid state properties, but the properties of the dimer.",contradiction
"Even though this potential has a larger number of parameters than Morse, the key point is that the potential is tested not only for the bulk solid but also for dimers as well as some microclusters.",contradiction
"Hence, it is of interest to explore to what extent this potential is capable of reproducing bulk solid and liquid state properties and compare the results with potentials strictly based on solid state properties.",contradiction
"We compute the phonon spectra and carry out quasiharmonic calculations to study the temperature-dependence of the lattice parameter (thermal expansion coefficient), specific heats at constant pressure and volume C p and C v, isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli B T and B S as a function of temperature.",contradiction
For the electronic part of the specific heat we use the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital (TB-LMTO) [12] scheme to compute the electronic density of states at the Fermi level as a function of the lattice parameter and use the independent quasiparticle result.,contradiction
To study the liquid structure at different temperatures we use Monte Carlo simulation and the standard Metropolis [13] sampling scheme.,contradiction
The remainder of this paper is divided into the following sections: In Section 2 we provide details of the potentials used.,contradiction
In Section 3 we discuss the calculation of the solid state properties and the comparison with experimental results.,contradiction
"In Section 4 we discuss the liquid structure as revealed by the pair distribution function, comparing the computed results with those obtained from diffraction experiments at different temperatures.",contradiction
A summary of results and conclusions are presented in Section 5.,contradiction
"The Morse potential is well-known and has the form(1)V(rij)=D[e?2?(rij?r0)?2e??(rij?r0)].This three-parameter (D, ? and r 0) potential has been used widely in the calculation of solids as well as molecules.",contradiction
"Like Lennard?Jones, it is one of the potentials that have shown some success in describing properties of molecules and solids with a minimal set of parameters.",contradiction
"Cotterill and Doyama [8?10] used experimental values of cohesive energy, lattice parameter and bulk modulus to obtain the three parameters for some fcc and bcc metals.",contradiction
In an alternate scheme they replaced cohesive energy with vacancy formation energy to fit the parameters.,contradiction
"In addition, the fit was performed in some cases for different numbers of neighbor cells, from nearest neighbors to 12 cells of neighbors.",contradiction
The parameters obtained for various cases are shown in Table 1 .,contradiction
Note that Cotterill and Doyama [8] did not consider the case of Ag in their work.,contradiction
"The Morse potential for Ag used by us is taken from the work of Flahive and Graham [9], which is based on the cohesive energy, and is considered in the list of potentials discussed by Erkoc? in a monograph edited by Stauffer [10].",contradiction
Morse potential based on vacancy formation energy for Ag is thus not included in our study.,contradiction
"The Erkoc? potential [11], based on energies of dimers and some consideration of the bulk properties of the solid, contains eight parameters in general.",contradiction

[11] the first six parameters of the set (A1,?1,?1,A2,?2,?2,D21,D22) were determined by using dimer data.",contradiction
"The remaining two parameters (D21,D22) were determined using bulk stability condition and bulk cohesive energy value.",contradiction
This potential was then applied to study clusters of 3?7 atoms.,contradiction
"If one takes D21=D22=1, then the potential represents dimer interaction.",contradiction
"If the determined values of (D21,D22) are used then the potential represents the effective pair-potential for bulk.",contradiction
"If one considers the product AnD2n,n=1,2 as a single parameter then the pair-potential can be thought of as a six-parameter potential.",contradiction
The values of the various parameters for this potential are provided in Table 2 .,contradiction
The Morse and Erkoc? potentials used in this work are shown in Fig. 1 .,contradiction
"The starting point of our quasiharmonic calculation of thermodynamical properties was the Helmholtz free energy of the crystal, which for a volume V or lattice constant a and at temperature T is given by(5)F(a,T)=Etot(a)+kBT?Ksln{2sinh??s(K,a)2kBT},where E tot is the static total energy given by Eq. (4) at a given volume V or lattice constant a.",contradiction
"?s(K,a) is the frequency of sth mode for a given wave vector K and lattice constant a.",contradiction
All thermodynamic properties were calculated from the free energy given by Eq. (5).,contradiction
"In obtaining the wave vector sum in Eq. (5) we considered a 203 uniform grid in the Brillouin zone (BZ), giving 256 wave vectors in the irreducible part.",contradiction
"The sum was performed using these 256 wave vectors, appropriately weighted according to the point-group symmetry of the fcc solid.",contradiction
The temperature variation of thermodynamic properties was studied from 0K to 1400K in steps of 2K.,contradiction
"The lattice contribution to the specific heat at constant volume C V was obtained from the temperature derivative of the total internal energy(6)CVph(T)=kB?Ks(??s(K)2kBT)2ž1sinh2[??s(K)/2kBT].To this the electronic part of the specific heat was added(7)CV(T)=CVph(T)+CVel(T),with CVel(T) calculated from the well-known expression(8)CVel(T)=?23kB2N(EF)Twhere N(EF) is the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level E F.",contradiction
"In the above expressions we considered the specific heats and N(EF) to be per atom, and used the well-documented Stuttgart TB-LMTO code [12] to compute the values of N(EF) for various lattice parameters.",contradiction
A brief description of the linear muffin-tin orbitals (LMTO) method and its tight-binding version (TB-LMTO) is given in a previous publication [18].,contradiction
"With increasing temperature, the lattice parameter increases, resulting in decreased overlap between neighboring orbitals and narrowing of the electronic bands, which produces a very small increase in N(EF).",contradiction
"However, this increase is negligible and the variation of CVel(T) with temperature remains essentially linear.",contradiction
We calculated the N(EF) for 5?6 values of lattice parameters in the entire temperature range and used linear interpolation to find the values at all other lattice parameters.,contradiction
"Eq. (8), which is based on the independent fermionic quasiparticle picture, includes all the electron?ion, exchange and correlation effects as incorporated within the framework of density functional theory.",contradiction
"What is neglected is the electron?phonon interaction, which is undoubtedly small for the metals considered, as none of these exhibits superconductivity down to almost absolute zero of temperature.",contradiction
"Linear response calculations of electron?phonon interaction, based on the full-potential LMTO method [22], show that for Cu and Ag it is indeed negligible and inclusion of any such effects will not have any noticeable change in results.",contradiction
"Indeed, the contribution of the electronic part itself to C V(T) remains less than 2% at temperatures of interest (room temperature and above).",contradiction
"The coefficient of linear thermal expansion is given by(9)?(T)=1ae(T)(dae(T)dT)p.In experimental works a e(T) in Eq. (9) is often replaced with ae(Tc) [23,24], where T c is a reference temperature, usually taken to be the room temperature.",contradiction
"To be consistent with experimental and other theoretical work [23], we consider Eq. (9) with ae(T)=ae(Tc); Tc=293.",contradiction
Our calculation of the free energy and thus equilibrium lattice parameter and thermal expansion coefficients ignores any contribution from the electron gas.,contradiction
"However, for thermal expansion the inclusion of electronic free energy for metals in general is expected to be comparable to the lattice contribution only at very low temperatures, of the order of 10K or less [25].",contradiction
For higher temperatures the neglect of electronic contribution is perfectly justified.,contradiction
"The isothermal bulk modulus at a temperature T is given by(10)BT(T)=V(?2F?V2)T=V(?2Etot?V2)+V(?2Fvib(a,T)?V2)T.The second derivatives in Eq. (10) were obtained via numerical differentiation.",contradiction
"The specific heat at constant pressure C P was obtained from(11)CP(T)?CV(T)=?T(?V?T)P2(?P?V)Tor(12)CP(T)=CVph(T)+CVel(T)+94?2(T)BT(T)ae3(T)T.Finally, the adiabatic bulk modulus B S was obtained from CP,CV and BT:CP/CV=BS/BT.",contradiction
From Fig. 4 it is clear that thermal expansion is best represented by the Erkoc? potential.,contradiction
"For Cu and Au the agreement between the experimental values and the calculated values based on the Erkoc? potential is perfect, while for Ag the agreement becomes poorer at higher temperatures.",contradiction
"However, Erkoc? still provides the best values among the three potentials studied.",contradiction
"The Morse potential based on vacancy formation energy severely overestimates thermal expansion, resulting in premature melting, while that based on the cohesive energy has the effect of underestimating thermal expansion for Cu and Au by 30?40% at high temperatures.",contradiction
"The variation of C V with temperature (Fig. 5 ) is almost identical for the Morse potentials based on vacancy formation and cohesive energies, and different from that given by the Erkoc? potential.",contradiction
"The specific heat at constant pressure C P (Fig. 6 ) is best represented by the Erkoc? potential over the entire temperature range, followed closely by the Morse potential based on the cohesive energy.",contradiction
"The values obtained by using the Morse potential based on the vacancy formation energies yield worst agreement with the experimental results, showing rapid increase in values at higher temperatures as a result of unusually high thermal expansion.",contradiction
"At low temperatures Erkoc? values are indistinguishable from the experimental results, while the Morse-S give somewhat lower values.",contradiction
"The Morse potential, particularly Morse-S, seems to do better than the Erkoc? potential in describing the isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli (Figs. 7 and 8 ).",contradiction
"However, the values are somewhat underestimated for Cu and Au even for the Morse potentials.",contradiction
"Like the isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli, elastic constants C 11, C 12 and C 44 show only very weak temperature-dependence.",contradiction
"In Table 3 we list the values of the elastic constants C 11, C 12 and C 44 calculated for different potentials at 0K and compare them with the corresponding room temperature experimental values [28,30].",contradiction
"Note that because the calculations are based on pair-potentials, the calculated values of C 12 and C 44 are identical [2].",contradiction
"The phonon spectra were calculated by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix, obtained from the Fourier transform of the force constant tensor ?ij(l,m) given by(3)?ij(l,m)=?2Etot?Ri(l)?Rj(m),where i,j are the labels of the atoms and l,m refer to Cartesian components of the position vectors of these atoms.",contradiction

The equilibrium lattice parameter values were obtained by minimizing the free energy at 300K for each potential used.,contradiction
The overall agreement between the computed and the measured dispersion is decidedly better for the Erkoc? potential than for the Morse.,contradiction
This is clearly the case for both Cu and Ag.,contradiction
Previous calculations based either on the pair potential or many body embedded atom model or similar potentials have shown [18] that it is much easier to obtain agreement for Cu than Ag or Au.,contradiction
"The reason is unclear, relativistic effects being one of the many other possible reasons.",contradiction
This is indicated by the observation that the agreement between the experiment and the calculation is in general the worst for Au.,contradiction
"It is clear that fitting to the bulk modulus does not guarantee correct slope near the zone center, unless the elastic constants C 11, C 12 and C 44 are also correctly reproduced.",contradiction
Even fitting to these elastic constants does not ensure that zone boundary phonon frequencies will come out right.,contradiction
"As pointed out by Daw and Hatcher [19], as long as the fitting is done primarily to elastic constants, which involve phonons near the zone center only, the agreement for high frequency phonons near the zone boundary is not guaranteed.",contradiction
"Often greater success is achieved, if instead of fitting to the properties of the solid at a given (equilibrium or otherwise) volume, consideration is given to fitting to the properties of the system at various different co-ordinations and densities, as was done in the case of the Erkoc? [11] potential.",contradiction
"In the absence of experimental properties to compare with, one could consider the results of accurate quantum mechanical calculation for dimers and other larger molecules and clusters.",contradiction
Such procedures seem to work well for rare gas solids [20].,contradiction
"Increasing the range of potential may have some merit up to a certain extent, but usually the improvement quickly saturates, and further improvement does not come solely from increasing the number of neighbor shells in the calculation.",contradiction
"This is demonstrated in Fig. 3 , where we compare the frequencies for Cu using the Morse potential and nearest neighbor (NN) fit and the fits involving 2- (2N), 6- (6N) and 12-neighbor (12N) shells.",contradiction
"There is significant improvement between the NN and 2N models, with some further improvement for the 6N case.",contradiction
"Beyond six shells of neighbors no further improvement is achieved, as evidenced by almost identical frequency values obtained for the 8N (not shown) and 12N cases.",contradiction
This observation is consistent with our earlier results [18] based on the embedded atom model potential of Mei et al. [21].,contradiction
"As stated earlier, for Ag the Morse potential based on the vacancy formation energy was not available and hence the corresponding phonon spectra do not appear in Fig. 2.",contradiction
"Since for Cu and Au the phonon frequencies for the potential based on the vacancy formation energy are found to be higher than the corresponding frequencies based on the cohesive (sublimation) energies, we expect the same to be true for Ag as well.",contradiction
"In the following discussion of the thermodynamic properties, the results for Ag for the Morse potential derived from the vacancy formation energy (Morse-V results) will be missing i.e. only Morse-S results will be discussed.",contradiction
"The trends, however, can be guessed by comparison with the results for Cu and Au.",contradiction
Liquid structures at various different temperatures were generated by the Monte Carlo method using the Metropolis sampling scheme [13].,contradiction
"Starting configurations were chosen to be either fcc or randomly positioned atoms within a cube of edge length decided by densities appropriate for liquid Cu, Ag and Au, as given by Waseda [31].",contradiction
"Particles were placed in cells with cubic boundaries, which were considered to be surrounded by periodic replicas on all sides.",contradiction
"If a move resulted in an atom getting out of the cell, then it was placed in periodically equivalent position within the cell before subjecting it to the Metropolis test.",contradiction
"Each atom was moved in succession by small steps of random size, with the maximum step size chosen to keep the success rate around 50%.",contradiction
Moves that lowered the energy were accepted and moves that increased the energy were accepted with a probability of exp(??E/kBT).,contradiction
The energy was calculated by considering two-body potentials discussed in the previous section.,contradiction
"Since the densities were already fixed, the only other check to test the suitability of the two-body potentials was to compute the pair correlation function and compare it with the experimental values tabulated in Waseda [31].",contradiction
"Of all the potentials studied, the Erkoc? potential fares best in describing melting as well as the pair distribution function g(r) in liquid Cu at various temperatures.",contradiction
"g(r) was calculated by dividing the distance into bins of length ?dr?, and counting the number of atoms in the bin ?dr?.",contradiction
"For a given distance ?r? between two atoms, the corresponding bin of width ?dr? is symmetrically chosen about ?r?, i.e. from r?dr/2 to r+dr/2.",contradiction
"The pair distribution function was calculated from g(r)=(V/N)(?N(r,dr)?/4?r2dr), where ?N(r,dr)? is the average number of atom pairs with an intervening distance in the interval [r?dr/2, r+dr/2].",contradiction
V is the cell volume and N is the number of particles in the cell.,contradiction
We present the results for g(r) in the form of histograms.,contradiction
"Of course, one can simply take this number as g(r) for the distance ?r? and present the result as a simple curve.",contradiction
"This would be equivalent to equating ?N(r,dr)? to ?N(r)?.",contradiction
We prefer the histogram option.,contradiction
Fig. 9 describes the results of simulation for Cu at different temperatures.,contradiction
"The starting cell was chosen to be fcc with 2048 particles in a cube of edge length 30.046A? corresponding to a density of 0.0755 atoms/A?3, appropriate for liquid Cu at a temperature of 1150øC [31].",contradiction
"The upper panel compares g(r) for the simulated cells at temperatures 550øC and 750øC with the spherically averaged pair distribution function for fcc configuration, while the lower panel compares the experimental liquid state g(r) at 1150øC with the simulation results at 950 and 1150øC.",contradiction
The upper panel shows the origin of the various peaks in the liquid structure.,contradiction
The second peak in the liquid state pair distribution function forms close to the distance of the third neighbor shell in the fcc structure.,contradiction
The second neighbor shell in the fcc structure loses its atoms to both the first and the second peak in the liquid state.,contradiction
The third peak in g(r) in the liquid state is close to the sixth neighbor distance in the fcc structure and is formed from the contributions from the fourth to the seventh shells in the fcc state.,contradiction
"The lower panel clearly indicates the absence of melting at 950øC, as all distant neighbor peaks survive at this temperature.",contradiction
"The simulation at 1150øC, on the other hand, shows complete lack of long range order, all peaks beyond the very weak fourth peak in g(r) disappear, and the agreement between the simulation result and the experimental g(r) obtained from neutron diffraction is very good.",contradiction
"The results in Fig. 10 show that even at 1000øC melting does not take place for the Erkoc? potential, as the distant peaks in g(r) survive.",contradiction
"The melting point of Cu is 1085øC at atmospheric pressure, with a density slightly higher than 0.0755atoms/A?3, which is the density chosen for the simulation.",contradiction
The simulation result for 1085øC and the density of 0.0755atoms/A?3 are virtually identical to that for 1150øC.,contradiction
"Fig. 11 shows the results of the simulation for Cu with the Erkoc? potential for three temperatures: 1300, 1500 and 1600øC.",contradiction
In each case the cell size is 2048 atoms with the cube edge adjusted to give the correct densities at these temperatures as reported in Waseda [31].,contradiction
It is clear that this potential is capable of reproducing the g(r) values in agreement with experiment up to at least 1500øC.,contradiction
At temperatures of 1600øC the second and higher order peaks of g(r) are shifted to a slightly higher distance compared to experimental results.,contradiction
A couple of comments are in order.,contradiction
"If we assume that melting can be considered to have occurred when all peaks in g(r) beyond those observed in experiment for the liquid disappear, then one can accordingly identify the cluster/cell as being a liquid or solid/crystalline.",contradiction
"However, the temperature at which this happens would be dependent on the cell size.",contradiction
In our simulation we find that for the Erkoc? potential this happens at much lower temperatures and in much better agreement with the experimental melting points than the Morse potentials fitted to solid state properties.,contradiction
"For example, for the Morse potentials based on sublimation/cohesive energy or bulk modulus of fcc Cu, agreement between the experimental g(r) values at 1150øC and those given by the Monte Carlo simulation can be achieved only if the simulation is carried out at a very high temperature, in excess of 2000øC.",contradiction
"For the Morse potential based on vacancy formation energy such agreement can be obtained for simulation at somewhat lower temperatures, e.g. 1600øC, but not at 1150øC.",contradiction
For generating the liquid Ag structure all the potentials studied were found somewhat deficient in the sense that the simulation needed to be carried out at a temperature much higher than the temperature at which the experimental g(r) was obtained.,contradiction
"However, the Erkoc? potential still fared best.",contradiction
"As shown in Fig. 12 , for generating the experimental g(r) at 1150øC the simulation using the Erkoc? potential needed to be carried out at temperatures 1700øC and above.",contradiction
"The agreement between simulation results and the experiment becomes progressively worse as we go from Cu to Au, i.e., 3-d to 5-d noble metal.",contradiction
"For gold, all potentials were found to be deficient.",contradiction
Morse potentials based on cohesive energies were the worst and needed the simulation to be performed at temperatures above 3500øC for agreement with experimental g(r) at 1150øC.,contradiction
Erkoc? and Morse-V potentials produced very similar results and could give reasonable results at 2550øC for agreement with experimental g(r) at 1150øC (Fig. 13 ).,contradiction
Fig. 1 should be useful in understanding our results regarding melting of the cells/boxes under different potentials.,contradiction
"Morse-S potentials are the deepest, so it is natural that these give the highest melting points, far above the experimental values.",contradiction
An important factor in melting is the anharmonicity of the potentials.,contradiction
The anharmonicity of the Erkoc? potential is different from that in the Morse potentials: it is softer than Morse on both sides of the potential minimum.,contradiction
Both repulsive and attractive parts of Erkoc? change less rapidly with distance around the potential minimum than their Morse counterparts.,contradiction
"This is why, even though Morse-V potentials are less deep than Erkoc?, the corresponding melting point is not lower.",contradiction
"An additional factor influencing the melting of the cells (boxes) is the density, which is kept fixed at the experimental liquid density at the temperature at which the structure factor of the liquid was measured and then used to compute the experimental pair distribution function.",contradiction
This constraint fixes the average distance under the first peak of g(r) to a large extent.,contradiction
Temperature changes the width of this peak as well as modifies the secondary peaks.,contradiction
It is the softness of the Erkoc potential that allows it to melt at a lower temperature at the prescribed density.,contradiction
The Morse-V case would show melting at a lower temperature if the density constraint were relaxed.,contradiction
"In this work two sets of two-body potentials are compared with regard to their effectiveness in describing the temperature variation of solid state properties as well as the liquid structure of noble metals: Cu, Ag and Au.",contradiction
"One group of potentials (Morse-type) is based on the solid state properties at a particular volume/temperature, namely equilibrium lattice parameter, bulk modulus, cohesive energy (Morse-S) or vacancy formation energy (Morse-V).",contradiction
The other group is based primarily on the energetics of dimers and micro-clusters (Erkoc? potential).,contradiction
"This latter group, which considers the system energies at various coordination and volumes per atom, appears to be more versatile in reproducing thermal expansion and specific heat, both at low and high temperatures, as well as the liquid structure.",contradiction
Phonon spectra are also better described by this group of potentials.,contradiction
Thermal expansion is underestimated if the potential is fitted to cohesive/sublimation energy (Morse-S) and overestimated if the potential is fitted to vacancy formation energy (Morse-V).,contradiction
"Fitting to elastic constants may give a better agreement for the slopes of the phonon spectra near the zone center with the measured values, but the agreement of phonon frequencies with the experimental values at the zone boundary is not guaranteed.",contradiction
Fitting to cohesive energy and bulk modulus does not ensure agreement even near the zone center.,contradiction
Bulk modulus is dependent on homogeneous deformation and cannot be considered as a suitable guide for symmetry lowering phonon frequencies.,contradiction
"In this regard, potentials based on energetics of small but diverse clusters may have some advantage.",contradiction
According to a previous study [20] similar results seem to apply to rare gas solids as well.,contradiction
"The other group of potentials may have an advantage in reproducing the temperature-dependence of elastic constants and bulk moduli, since they are based on room temperature values of these properties, which show only weak temperature-dependence in general for all metals.",contradiction
It is well-known that in metals the presence of free electrons makes the total energy or the cohesive energy strongly dependent on the system volume/density.,contradiction
"As a result, volume-independent pair potentials are not deemed suitable for describing properties of metals.",contradiction
"Several approaches, such as Finnis?Sinclair-type many body potentials [5,6] and the embedded atom method [4,21], have been proposed in this regard, where the total energy is written as a sum of pair-potentials and a function that depends on the density of the electrons at a particular lattice site.",contradiction
In practical implementations of such methods the parameters involved in the pair-potential part and the density-dependent function are always obtained by fitting to some reference state properties.,contradiction
The results of the present work should be relevant for these schemes as well.,contradiction
"Additional work exploring the suitability of some of the fitting schemes, such as the ones discussed in this work, is currently in progress.",contradiction
In a recent work Liu and Cohen (Phys.,contradiction
Rev.,contradiction
"B., 41 (1990) 10 727-10 734) reported the theoretical prediction of a C-N phase whose hardness was competing with that of diamond.",contradiction
This work provoked extensive experimental search for the theoretical material with a composition ?-C3N4.,contradiction
"There was a report (Niu, Lu and Lieber, Science, 261 (1993) 334?337) on the growth ?-C3N4 films.",contradiction

"Lett., 237 (1995) 72) reported that the synthesized material, in most cases, corresponds to ?-C3N4 and not to ?-C3N4.",contradiction
We review the evidence from a number of papers and conclude that there is not enough evidence that C3N4 can be produced as large crystals.,contradiction
"It is clear, however, that the ?-C3N4 is more stable than the ?-C3N4 phase.",contradiction
"We discuss the recent report (Sarikaya, Qian, Martin-Gil, Martin-Gil and Jose?-Yacama?n, to be published) in which a new phase with the composition ?-CxNy with x4 and y4 is found.",contradiction

"Zinc aluminate (ZnAl2O4), naturally occurring as the mineral gahnite, is a member of the spinel family.",contradiction
"At present zinc aluminate is used as a catalyst for the dehydration of saturated alcohols to olefins,1 methanol and higher alcohol synthesis,2,3 preparation of polymethylbenzenes,4 synthesis of styrenes from acetophenons,5 and double bond isomerisation of alkenes.6 Furthermore, zinc aluminate can also be used as a catalyst support, since it has a high thermal stability, low acidity and a hydrophobic behaviour.",contradiction
"Moreover, it has a strong metal?support interaction preventing e.g. platinum and platinum/tin to sinter.7 Finally, zinc aluminate can be used as a second phase in glaze layers of white ceramic tiles to improve wear resistance and mechanical properties and to preserve whiteness.8 Zinc aluminate is normally synthesised via a solid-state reaction of zinc and aluminium oxides above 800 øC9,10 or via coprecipitation,7,12 hydrothermal 11 and sol-gel methods with several organic precursors.10,12?14 It could be used as a ceramic material similar to e.g. magnesium aluminate (MgAl2O4) and manganese?zinc ferrites [(Mn,Zn)Fe2O4].",contradiction
"However, in the literature only a few papers have been published about the sintering of zinc aluminate ceramics,9,15?17 rendering many bulk properties, e.g. Young's modulus, unknown.",contradiction
"In this paper, the preparation of dense zinc aluminate ceramics is reported and some of its elastic, thermophysical and dielectric properties are determined.",contradiction
"Furthermore, attention is paid to the influence of preparation on cation inversion, which occurs in spinels.",contradiction
In predictions of the bulk properties using computer simulations this cation inversion is usually neglected.,contradiction
"However, for a good comparison between experiment and simulation it is required to have information about the (small) cation inversion in zinc aluminate.",contradiction
The crystal structure of spinel stricto sensu (MgAl2O4) has been independently determined by Bragg18 and Nishikawa19 in 1915.,contradiction
It has the space group F d3m (O h 7 number 227 in the International Tables 20) and has a cubic structure made of eight molecular units (AB2O4).,contradiction
There are three main groups of compounds with the spinel structure and the chemical formula AB2O4.,contradiction

Magnesium aluminate and zinc aluminate are examples of this group.,contradiction
In the second group the A cation is tetravalent en the B cations divalent.,contradiction
U?lvospinel (TiFe2O4) is a well-known member of this group.,contradiction
Spinels from the third group have vacancies on sites where cations should be.,contradiction
A well-known example is ?-alumina.,contradiction
"One unit cell of a compound with the spinel structure is built up from 32 oxygen atoms arranged in a fcc-lattice, giving 64 tetrahedral and 32 octahedral interstices.",contradiction
In a II?III spinel the divalent A cations occupy eight tetrahedral interstices and the trivalent B cations occupy 16 octahedral interstices.,contradiction
This distribution of the cations is designated as normal.,contradiction
"However, this is thermodynamically not always the most stable situation, since the configurational entropy counteracts the site preference energy.",contradiction
"Therefore, in spinels A and B cations may interchange interstices via diffusion, eventually leading to the limiting situation where all the A cations are in octahedral interstices.",contradiction
The latter situation is designated as inverted.,contradiction
"All distributions between the two extremes are possible and the degree of inversion is given by the inversion parameter x, which is defined as the fraction of A cations in octahedral sites.",contradiction
The inversion parameter x can be obtained via careful single crystal X-ray diffraction or via nuclear magnetic resonance with magic angle spinning (MAS?NMR).,contradiction
"In the latter case x can be obtained for aluminates from the peak areas by:(1)x=21+A1VI/A1IV ,where AlVI is the peak area of aluminium cations in an octahedral surrounding (?0?10 ppm) and Al?? of the aluminium cations in a tetrahedral surrounding (?60?70 ppm).",contradiction
"The inversion in zinc aluminate is known, by X-ray diffraction,24?26 to be small in contrast to e.g. magnesium aluminate.27 Moreover, in computer simulations the inversion of zinc and aluminium atoms is also found to be energetically unfavourable.28,29 Furthermore, NMR studies on the cation inversion in zinc aluminate, which is prepared via the solid-state synthesis route, confirm the virtual absence of inversion.30 However, inversion has been found to some extent in zinc aluminate synthesized using a sol-gel method with alkoxides depending on the temperature.14",contradiction

XRD measurements showed that zinc aluminate powder (JCPDS file 05-0669) has been formed (see Fig. 1 ).,contradiction

"This is in agreement with the results from Keller et al.,10 who found that at 1000 øC ?95% pure zinc aluminate results.",contradiction
"The presence of ?- or ?-alumina, which would have formed when ?-alumina is heated to the applied temperatures,32 or ?-alumina was not detected in any sample.",contradiction

The large surface area and presence of a flow in the furnace increases the deficiency for the zinc aluminate prepared via the sol-gel method as compared to the material prepared via the solid state route.,contradiction
The lower concentration of zinc in the coprecipitated zinc aluminate is due to heating without the lid.,contradiction
"The NMR spectra of the zinc aluminate powders prepared via the solid state and coprecipitation are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively.",contradiction

"The large degree of inversion in the sol-gel prepared zinc aluminate cannot be attributed to the presence of aluminium cations with four or five oxygen atom surroundings at the surface, as zinc aluminate prepared via the sol-gel route has a large surface area.35 The NMR experiments were performed in a quantitative manner, revealing that all aluminium cations are detected and that shielding of the bulk cations did not occur.",contradiction
"This implies that the inversion is occurring in the bulk and is not an artefact of surface aluminium cations, since they form only a minor fraction of all the aluminium cations.",contradiction
"The NMR spectra have been measured on a largely zinc deficient zinc aluminate, which implies an excess of aluminium cations forming aluminium oxide.",contradiction
The absence of a second phase in XRD spectra suggests that a ?solid solution? of the spinel phase of aluminium oxide (?-alumina) and zinc aluminate has been formed resulting in the presence of a large amount of aluminium cations in tetrahedral interstices.,contradiction
In ?-alumina 25% of the aluminium cations are located at tetrahedral interstices32 and therefore will contribute to the peak at 60 ppm.,contradiction
"In order to determine the inversion parameter of pure zinc aluminate from these spectra, a correction to Eq. (1) for this ?-alumina contribution must be made.",contradiction
"The inversion parameter for zinc deficient zinc alumina (Zn1?yAl2O4?y) is given by:(2)x=21+AlVI/AlIV ?12y The first term on the right hand side of Eq. (2), for all powders prepared via the solid state route and coprecipitation, equals 0.04ñ0.01 and for the sol-gel method 0.23ñ0.02.",contradiction
"Application of the correction for the zinc aluminate prepared via the solid state route (y=0.05) and sol-gel method (y=0.52) gives an inversion parameter of 0.015 and ?0.01, respectively.",contradiction
"However, a systematic error is present in estimating the inversion parameter from MAS-NMR spectra due to the location of some intensity in the spinning side bands and to the baseline correction.",contradiction
The results obtained are within the error range the same and it is concluded that the inversion parameter for of pure zinc aluminate is very small irrespective of the preparation method.,contradiction
The density of the sintered zinc aluminate tablets has been measured using the Archimedes? method with water as the displaceable fluid for densities higher than 90% and below 90% by the measuring the dimensions and weight of the tablet.,contradiction
The density as a function of the sintering temperature is shown in Fig. 5 .,contradiction
The density increases with sintering temperature and remains constant at 93% from 1300 øC onwards.,contradiction
"Sidorov found that single phase zinc aluminate powder calcined at 1250 øC did not sinter without additives like TiO2 up to 1650 øC.15 However, Hong et al. found that single phase powder calcined at 1300 øC did sinter, but reached at 1400 øC a maximum density of 80%.9 In this work, the zinc aluminate powder was calcined at 1000 øC, indicating that some zinc oxide is still present.",contradiction
This latter compound reacts during sintering and can contribute to an extra densification.,contradiction
"However, since the average of the densities of zinc oxide (5.679 g cm?3) and aluminium oxide (3.990 g cm?3) is smaller that the density of zinc aluminate (4.611 g cm?3), this reaction will leave pores and therefore a 100% density cannot be reached.",contradiction
The Young's modulus has been measured using the pulse?echo method as a function of density and is shown in Fig. 6 .,contradiction
The absence of experimental data above a density of 95% makes it impossible to predict an accurate value for the zero porosity Young's modulus.,contradiction

"For the determination of the maximum thermal diffusivity and maximum thermal conductivity (B=0),37 the intercept at the inverse thermal diffusivity axis (=A/2) or the intercept at the temperature axis (=?D,r/2b) should be known in combination with the slope A? (=bA/?D,r).",contradiction
"The estimated maximum thermal conductivity of the tablets investigated at 300 K are calculated using ?D=896 K as calculated from the phonon spectrum,38 n=14 and b=2.",contradiction
The results are also shown in Table 1.,contradiction
The three tablets investigated differ in porosity.,contradiction
"This would imply a constant value for A?, which only contains intrinsic diffusivity properties, and different values for B?, which also contains influences due to pores.",contradiction
"However, the values for A? differ somewhat, which imply that next to porosity the samples also differ in other aspects.",contradiction
"In particular, the difference in sinter temperature might have influenced the pore shape and/or the composition to certain extent, since at high temperatures zinc can evaporate from the ceramic39 although precautions have been taken to prevent it.",contradiction
The maximum achievable thermal conductivity at 300 K as estimated using the above described procedure is about 20?25 W m?1 K?1.,contradiction
The large difference between the experimental values of 12?14 W m?1 K?1 and the above estimated are due to the large porosity.,contradiction

"The structural, elastic, thermophysical and dielectric properties of zinc aluminate have been investigated.",contradiction
"Zinc aluminate powders have been prepared at different temperatures, with different reaction times and via different preparation routes (solid-state, coprecipitation and sol-gel).",contradiction

"Dollase [1] used a cylindrically symmetric version of an ellipsoidal model showed by March to describe the pole distribution in a powder sample(1)P(?)=[r2 cos 2 ?+r?1 sin 2 ?]?3/2,where ? is the angle between the preferred orientation (PO) direction and the reciprocal lattice vector direction for Bragg peak.",contradiction
The single parameter r controls the distribution shape and is an index of the extent of PO.,contradiction
The March r-parameter is unity for an ideal random powder sample.,contradiction
The March model is normalizable over the full angular range.,contradiction
The normalization is important in that changes in the pole density shape conserve the total intensity within the diffraction pattern.,contradiction
"Therefore, scale factors obtained by Rietveld refinement with the March model is reliable for absolute phase composition analysis and crystal structure determination.",contradiction
The model has been extensively employed in Rietveld refinement.,contradiction
"While the March model is an excellent descriptor of PO for gibbsite [2] X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data, the model has proved to be deficient for Rietveld modelling with molybdite, calcite and kaolinite XRD data [7].",contradiction
"Therefore, the model should not be regarded as a general-purpose pole distribution descriptor [3].",contradiction
"In the present study, the relationship between the compaction pressure (?P) and March parameter (r) has been developed from the definition of bulk modulus [7].",contradiction
"Consider a planar powder diffraction sample formed by a volume conserving, cylindrical symmetric, flattening such that the initial sample thickness (d 0) is reduced to a thickness (d).",contradiction

"For platy crystallites, a plot of r versus ?P should be linear, and would yield the bulk modulus, whereas a plot of 1/r versus ?P would be required for acicular crystallites.",contradiction
"The aim of the present study is to test the expression which links the March r-parameter to the uniaxially pressured via the powder bulk modulus, B.",contradiction

"Bulk modulus measurements were made with powder samples using the die, which had been employed to prepare samples for neutron powder diffraction (ND).",contradiction
Approximately 15g of powder was placed in a cylindrical steel die assembly of diameter 19mm.,contradiction
The plunger was then inserted into the die and allowed to stabilize.,contradiction
"The distance between the compressor and the top of die (L 0), corresponding to the initial (unstressed) height of the cylindrical powder volume, was measured using a vernier calliper to an accuracy of 0.02mm.",contradiction

Fig. 1 shows plots of r versus ?P for molybdite and calcite.,contradiction
The expected linear form of the r versus ?P plot has been tested against a linear regression fit.,contradiction
"It is not clear from the scatter of points in the plot that the relation is linear for molybdite, whereas the results for calcite show that the application of pressure increases the r-parameter linearly from 1.00 as expected from Eq. (2).",contradiction
Fig. 1 shows the gradient of the regression plot has a positive sign.,contradiction
"It is interesting to note, that the unpressed samples gave results consistent with the material being randomly oriented.",contradiction
"Therefore, it might be concluded that the March model is a good descriptor of PO modeling for the ND data.",contradiction
"However, the goodness of fit (GOFI) (Table 1) still substantially exceeded the ?expected? value 1.00 when the March model was applied to the data for the pressed samples in which the GOFI ranges from 2.1 to 5.3 for molybdite and 2.2?3.3 for calcite.",contradiction
The agreement indices for calcite indicate that the model was effective for the ND data.,contradiction
Fig. 2 shows plot of powder cylinder length (L) versus uniaxial pressure for molybdite and calcite.,contradiction
"Eq. (2) was used to estimate the bulk modulus for each powder, see Table 2 for results.",contradiction
"Interpretation of the results in Table 2 requires some preliminary comment on the assumption underpinning the methods used to determine bulk moduli, (i) directly from compression measurements and (ii) from plots of Rietveld r-parameter versus uniaxial pressure (see Fig. 1 and Table 1).",contradiction
"For both methods it was assumed that the pressure?volume relationship is linear for the samples examined, whereas the powder volume is expected to plateau as the pressure increases, signifying that the porosity has become minimal.",contradiction
"The bulk PO, observed from the Rietveld results for calcite, suggest that the direct measurement results might be expected to conform closely with the ND bulk modulus values.",contradiction
"The results indicate that (i) the plot for molybdite is linear, and the bulk modulus measured directly exceeds the Rietveld ND results and (ii) the plot for calcite clear indications of ?plateuing? as pressure increases, i.e. non-linearity in the pressure?volume relationship, (iii) the molybdite bulk moduli from the ND Rietveld plots, while comparable with the ?directly measured? values, are both approximately 60% of the corresponding measured value, indicating some possible deficiency in the March model, and (iv) the calcite ND results agree closely with the directly measured value.",contradiction
? The March model appears to provide adequate PO representations for moderate levels of PO.,contradiction
? The descriptions from ND analysis are probably correct for the bulk material and not substantially influenced by the pressing procedure.,contradiction
"? A formalism developed in the study for converting the March r-parameter to a bulk modulus estimate (and, therefore, a measure of powder compressibility) has been tested using direct measurements of bulk modulus.",contradiction
The pressure dependence of the librational spectrum of the ammonium perovskite NH4ZnF3 in its two structural phases has been obtained by neutron inelastic scattering experiments.,contradiction
In the cubic phase the energy of the librational bands increases with decreasing interatomic distances.,contradiction
"This trend is opposite to expectation from the known trend by metal substitution in the NH4MF3 series (M=Zn, Mn, Cd).",contradiction
"It is shown that, at least in the Zn compound, the repulsive components of the interaction potential are very small.",contradiction
The mode Gru?neissen parameter of the librational modes has been obtained (?=3.6) with the help of the bulk modulus determined from the p-V plot also measured in the present work by x-ray diffraction.,contradiction
"Finally, Yasuda's relationship between the ? J parameters, which describe the angular dependence of the interaction potential, and the atom-atom potential functions (dependent on the interatomic distances) has been verified by the evolution of the parameter ? 6, deduced from the librational bands, when pressure is applied.",contradiction
"Haucke phases [1], AB5 (A=rare-earth and B= d- and p-block elements), are known to absorb hydrogen up to the approximate composition of 6 H atoms per formula unit at mild conditions of temperature and pressure (?298K and ?2ž105 Pa).",contradiction
This enables their use in rechargeable metal hydride batteries [2].,contradiction
The hydrogen storage capacity for LaNi5 amounts to ?1.38wt.% which exceeds that of liquid hydrogen by ?40%.,contradiction
"Nevertheless its gravimetric capacity is still small with respect to that of archetype hydride for applications, MgH2, which amounts to ?7.6wt.%.",contradiction
It is also important to mention the remarkable feature of the rapid kinetics of the LaNi5?H2 system [3].,contradiction
"The experiment reports the formation of two hydrogen solutions, namely primary ?-LaNi5H0.5 and more filled ?-La2Ni10H12 (Z =1) [4,5].",contradiction
"The ? phase crystallizes in the same space group (SG) as the pure alloy system whereas the ? phase is characterized in two different SGs, namely P63mc and P31c.",contradiction
"For the latter hydride phase, neither the experiment nor previous ab initio calculations were able to discard either SGs.",contradiction
"On the other hand, LaNi5 is reported to be paramagnetic by the experiment [6].",contradiction
"With respect to this specific point, previous ab initio calculations have been performed but the resulting ground state configuration was different to the one reported by the experiment.",contradiction
"For instance, early calculations performed within the augmented plane wave method (APW) showed that LaNi5 is a ?very weak ferromagnet? with a total moment of 0.69?B [7].",contradiction
Recent calculations gave total moment values such as 1.25 and 1.15?B with the self-consistent linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) within the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) and the full potential (FP) LMTO methods respectively [8].,contradiction
The authors commented these results by considering that the discrepancy of the total moment with respect to the experiment may be due to a delicate problem of calculation of the total energy when the material is in a transitional state between a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic states.,contradiction
"In this paper the electronic structure, energetics and magnetic ground state configuration of LaNi5 and its saturated hydrogen ? solution are analyzed from first-principles.",contradiction
The calculations are done with two complementary methods built within the density functional theory (DFT) [9?11] : a pseudo-potential (PP) method and an all-electron method.,contradiction
"Using the PP method, we first revisit the symmetry of the ? models to check for the most stable SG from both a structural and an energetic points of view.",contradiction
We also study the binding of hydrogen within the host lattice.,contradiction
The latter property is further evaluated by computing an additional hypothetic intermediate hydride model LaNi5H3 at the SGs of both the pure alloy and the ? hydride systems.,contradiction
Secondly we examine the ground state of LaNi5 by evaluating the electronic band occupations in both non-spin polarized (NSP) and spin polarized (SP) configurations provided by all-electron method.,contradiction
"Finally, we study the energetics of hydrogen uptake in the ? hydride as far as it is generally controlled by a size factor and an electronic factor.",contradiction
The volume expansion brought by hydrogen insertion in the host lattice usually induces a magnetization in such systems anticipated namely at the d- and p-block elements constituents.,contradiction
In the case of LaNi5 one can presume the onset of a local magnetic moment carried by nickel atoms.,contradiction
"It is important to study the magnetization of the hydride system relevant to the interplay of magnetovolume effects versus the chemical bonding of hydrogen with the different atomic constituents, especially with nickel atoms.",contradiction
"LaNi5 system crystallizes in the hexagonal CaCu5-type, P6/mmm SG, Haucke structure [1].",contradiction
"For this phase, depicted in Fig. 1(b) and (c), La atoms occupy Wyckoff general position 1a at (0, 0, 0), while Ni atoms lye in two nonequivalent crystallographic sites: 2c at (1/3, 2/3, 0) and 3g at (1/2, 0, 1/2).",contradiction
"When hydrogen is absorbed into the lattice, a primary solid solution (the ? phase) is formed without any change in the general crystal symmetry [4].",contradiction
"For space group P6/mmm one can argue around five possible hydrogen sites namely octahedral 3f (2La?2Ni 2c ?2Ni 3g) and tetrahedral 4h (Ni 2c ?3Ni 3g), 6m (2La?2Ni 3g), 12o (La?Ni 2c ?2Ni 3g) and 12n (La?2Ni 3g ?Ni 3g).",contradiction
"The 3f and/or 12n sites have been most frequently concluded as the favorable occupation sites [4,12?14].",contradiction
One can explain this with respect to the atomic surroundings of hydrogen within the former octahedral site on one hand and the reported hole size of the latter tetrahedral site of ?0.408A? on the other hand which is concomitant to the Westlake criterion [15] that imposes a minimum interstitial hole size of 0.40A?.,contradiction
"Consequently, the 6m site cannot be ruled out with its hole radius of ?0.551A? [13].",contradiction
However a saturated hydride (the ? phase) exists with two possible ordered structures as reported by neutron diffraction data [5].,contradiction
These have the P63mc and the P31c symmetries respectively.,contradiction
They both show a doubled unit cell along the c-axis.,contradiction
"Within the SG P31c, La atoms are located in special 2a position at (0, 0, z).",contradiction
"Ni atoms are found within three nonequivalent positions: Ni1 in six-fold 6c position at (x, y, z) and Ni2(3) in two-fold 2b position at (1/3, 2/3, z).",contradiction
"There are fourteen hydrogen atoms at three different crystallographic sites, namely 6c (H1) with an octahedral surrounding (2La?2Ni1?Ni2?Ni3) and 2b (H2) and 6c (H3) with a tetrahedral surrounding (3Ni1?Ni2 and 2La?2Ni1 respectively).",contradiction
For more details refer to Fig. 1(a).,contradiction
"The difference between the two SGs is relevant to the presence of a mirror plane within P63mc for the site 6c which leads to a particular position (x, x ?, z) with respect to (x, y, z) in P31c.",contradiction
Thus Ni and H atoms are found within the hydride with the P63mc symmetry in the same locations and with the same foldings except for Ni1 which occupies a position that only differs from its P31c homologue by a mirror symmetry shift along the y-ordinate direction.,contradiction
"In the following, the hydride phases crystallizing with SGs P63mc and P31c will be referred to as ?1 and ?2 respectively.",contradiction
A sketch of the ?1 structure is given in Fig. 1(a).,contradiction
Two computational methods were used in the framework of DFT.,contradiction
"A PP approach within the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code [16] was firstly used to optimize the starting structures for the different hydride phases using projector augmented wave (PAW) [17,18] potentials built within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [20] scheme.",contradiction
The optimization of the structural parameters is performed until the forces on the atoms are less than 0.02eV/A? and all stress components are below 0.003eV/A?3.,contradiction
The calculations were converged at an energy cut-off of 336.95eV for the plane-wave basis set.,contradiction
The tetrahedron method with Blo?chl corrections [17] as well as a Methfessel?Paxton scheme [21] for conducting systems were applied for both geometry relaxation and total energy calculations.,contradiction
Brillouin zone (BZ) integrals were approximated using the special ? centered k-point grids adapted for hexagonal cells with a starting mesh of 4*4*4 up to 8*8*8 for best convergence and relaxation to zero strains.,contradiction
"This sampling of the BZ is equivalent to that given by Monkhorst and Pack [22] with a shift of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) from the origin of the latter and vice versa.",contradiction
"Further, from PP calculations a mapping of the electrons within the lattice can be obtained.",contradiction
This provides an insight into the charge density distribution as well as into the localization of electrons around the chemical constituents which gives a view of the bonding in systems.,contradiction
"The latter is the electron localization function (ELF) introduced by Becke and Edgecombe [23,24].",contradiction
It allows determining the amount of localization of electrons with respect to the free electron gas distribution.,contradiction
The dimensionless ELF magnitude ranges from 0 to 1 with ELF=1/2 corresponding to the free electron gas distribution.,contradiction
"These three extreme situations will be illustrated by three sets of colors: ELF=0 points to no localization (blue contours), ELF=1 points to strong localization (red contours) and ELF=1/2 with green contours.",contradiction
"All-electron calculations were performed using the scalar-relativistic implementation of the augmented spherical wave (ASW) method [25,26].",contradiction
These computations are based on DFT and the GGA scheme as parameterized by Wu and Cohen [27].,contradiction
"In the ASW method, the wave function is expanded in atom-centered augmented spherical waves, which are Hankel functions and numerical solutions of Schro?dinger's equation, respectively, outside and inside the so-called augmentation spheres.",contradiction
"In the minimal ASW basis set, we chose the outermost shells to represent the valence states and the matrix elements were constructed using partial waves up to l max +1=4 for La, l max +1=3 for Ni and l max +1=2 for H.",contradiction
It needs to be said that calculations are started for neutral atom configurations.,contradiction
They are ab initio and self-consistent with increasing k-points precision in the hexagonal BZ.,contradiction
"Convergence is obtained when negligible variations for the charges (?Q =10?8) and for the total energy (?E =10?7 eV), are observed between two successive iterative cycles.",contradiction
"In order to optimize the basis set, additional augmented spherical waves were placed at carefully selected interstitial sites (IS).",contradiction
The choice of these sites as well as the augmentation radii were automatically determined using the sphere-geometry optimization algorithm [28].,contradiction
Self-consistency was achieved by a highly efficient algorithm for convergence acceleration [29].,contradiction
"The BZ integrations were performed using the linear tetrahedron method with up to 504 k-points within the irreducible wedge [17,26].",contradiction
The efficiency of this method in treating magnetism and chemical bonding properties in transition-metal and rare-earth compounds has been well demonstrated in recent years [30?32].,contradiction
"The results obtained from DFT based calculations provide accurate indications to quantities such as the magnitudes of the magnetic moments, the nature and energy position of the states with respect to the Fermi level (E F), the ground state configuration from relative energies etc.",contradiction
However a tool is needed to provide information about the nature of the chemical bond between two atomic constituents.,contradiction
"This can be obtained from different available schemes, such as the crystal orbital overlap population (COOP) [33], the crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) [34] or the ?covalent bond energy? (ECOV) [35] criteria.",contradiction
The latter combines both COHP and COOP so as to make the resulting quantity independent of the choice of the zero of potential.,contradiction
"In the present work, the ECOV criterion was used for the chemical bonding analysis.",contradiction
"In the plots, negative, positive and zero magnitudes of the unit less ECOV are indicative of bonding, antibonding, and nonbonding interactions respectively.",contradiction
"Fig. 1 shows the electron localization function mapping for LaNi5 (b,c) and the ?1 model (a).",contradiction
A diagonal plane along the c-axis cuts through H and La for Fig. 1(a) and La and Ni for Fig. 1(b).,contradiction
While Fig. 1(c) shows the ELF along the plane (0 0 0).,contradiction
"For LaNi5 it is clear from the yellow distorted pentagon shapes between lanthanum and nickel, i.e. in Fig. 1(b), that there is a charge transfer between the different atomic constituents.",contradiction
"Further, one can notice the green areas between the atomic species (Fig. 1(b) and (c)).",contradiction
This points to a smeared electron distribution within the system similarly to a free electron like character expected within a metallic network.,contradiction
"On the other hand, a strong localization is seen around hydrogen sites within the hydride system (see Fig. 1(a)).",contradiction
"This agrees with the ?hydride? picture of the system, i.e. with negatively charged hydrogen.",contradiction
"LaNi5 [1] as well as its ? and ? hydride phases [5,13] are characterized by the experiment which established two possible SGs for the ? phase, i.e. P31c and P63mc.",contradiction
It is then necessary to optimize the geometry of both systems prior to further calculations.,contradiction
From energy differences this should help pointing to the favorable symmetry for the saturated hydride as the one with the most stable energy between the two ? models.,contradiction
It is worth mentioning that a similar attempt has been made before from first-principles computations without being able to discard either of the two SGs with respect to the total energy values of the optimized structures [36].,contradiction
Nevertheless the internal parameters for both models were very close to those generated with SG P63mc whereby the authors concluded that the latter SG is more favorable.,contradiction
Also calculations performed by the same authors without geometry optimization were energetically favorable with respect to the SG P63mc.,contradiction
The pure alloy was also optimized to establish an equation of state which allows to compare quantities such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus with the hydride models.,contradiction
Primary ? phase has the composition LaNi5H0.5 with several possible hydrogen insertion sites as discussed in section 2.,contradiction
A hydride model was optimized with a fully occupied 3f site resulting into a composition such as LaNi5H3 in order to avoid any breaking of the symmetry.,contradiction
This model can be considered as an intermediate hydride phase and compared to the pure alloy with respect to the pressure effects brought by the insertion of hydrogen in the host lattice.,contradiction
From the latter intermediate hydride a model was built with a doubled cell along the c-axis resulting into a composition such as La2Ni10H6 (Z =2).,contradiction
An additional model with the same SG of the ?1 hydride model was also considered.,contradiction
Within this model H occupies the octahedral 6c sites resulting into an intermediate hydride La2Ni10H6 (Z =1).,contradiction
This choice of H occupation site was done with respect to the other intermediate model which holds H in an octahedral site.,contradiction
As far as the difference between ?1 and ?2 models does not affect the surroundings of hydrogen atoms in their insertion sites (see section 2) there was no need to consider a model with the same SG of the ?2 hydride model.,contradiction
The latter two models are then important to establish a comparison with the saturated hydride system with respect to the binding of hydrogen within the host lattice.,contradiction
It is important to mention that the geometry optimizations are based on a spin degenerate configuration despite the paramagnetic character of LaNi5.,contradiction
"This is due to the fact that the spin directions are not linked to the crystalline structure (such as in noncollinear spin systems), i.e. the system is invariant under a general common rotation of all spins.",contradiction
While in the presence of spin orbit interaction SOI (collinear spin along the z direction) the spin directions become linked to the crystalline structure.,contradiction
Since in the case of LaNi5 there is no SOI then assuming spin degeneracy is less significant with respect to the geometry optimization issues.,contradiction
In a first step a geometry optimization was carried out on LaNi5 using the PP based method (VASP).,contradiction
The starting internal parameters (see section 2) as well as the lattice constants (a =5.017A? and c =3.986A?) are taken from the experiment [1].,contradiction
The resulting structure was found similar to the experimental one with respect to the SG symmetry and the atomic species positions.,contradiction
The optimized lattice parameters values are such as (a =5.001A?) and (c =3.963A?) which are less than 1% lower than the experiment.,contradiction
This gives confidence to the optimization scheme and the used potentials.,contradiction
Now more complicated structures such as the hydride phases can be optimized.,contradiction
The crystal structures of both ? phase hydrides are described in section 2.,contradiction
The initial parameters for the special positions of the different atomic constituents are those given by the experiment [5].,contradiction
A detailed description of the initial internal parameters for the starting optimization calculations is given in Table 1 .,contradiction
An analysis of the optimized parameters can be then performed based on the listed informations.,contradiction
The value of the ratio c/a will be considered for the discussion of the optimized lattice constants with respect to the experiment.,contradiction
This ratio is 1.8 and 0.5% larger than its experimental values for the ?1 and ?2 models respectively.,contradiction
The internal parameters in both models are closer to the symmetry of SG P63mc with respect to P31c.,contradiction
"In previous ab initio calculations [36] showing the same trends, the authors pointed towards P63mc as the favorable SG for the hydride system.",contradiction
Nevertheless this must be confirmed by a comparison of the total energies.,contradiction
"In order to obtain the equilibrium volumes and confront them with the experiment, (energy, volume) values were computed around the experimental data.",contradiction
"The resulting E(V) curves are plotted in Fig. 2(a) and (b) for LaNi5, ?1(2) hydride models and all the intermediate hydride models.",contradiction
The resulting equilibrium volumes for the saturated hydride models are 218.6 and 219.0A?3 for ?1 and ?2 respectively.,contradiction
These values are close to the experimental volume which amounts to 217.9A?3.,contradiction
The volume of LaNi5H3 model is larger than that of the pure alloy by ?12A?3.,contradiction
"To compare the volume expansion brought by H insertion within the intermediate hydride with that of the saturated hydride models, one needs to consider both La2Ni10H6 (Z =1) and (Z =2) models.",contradiction
Fig. 2(b) shows that these two intermediate models have very close E(V) curves.,contradiction
This also results into very close equilibrium volumes of ?196A?3.,contradiction
Then the volume differences with the saturated hydride result to a ? model volume larger by ?23A?3 with respect to La2Ni10H6 models.,contradiction
This amount should be divided by two in order to compare it with the difference between between the pure alloy and LaNi5H3.,contradiction
This results into a value of ?11.5A?3 which is close to the volume difference between LaNi5 and LaNi5H3.,contradiction
The cohesive energy of the hydride system E coh is another significant quantity that can be investigated using the equilibrium energy values.,contradiction
"E coh describes the binding of hydrogen within the lattice and is expressed as follows:Ecoh=1n[E(LaNi5Hn)?E(LaNi5)]?12E(H2),Here n is the amount of hydrogen present in the host lattice.",contradiction
"E(LaNi5Hn), E(LaNi5) represent the total energies of the hydride models and the pure alloy system respectively.",contradiction
These are given in the inserts of Fig. 2(a) and (b).,contradiction
E(H2) is the energy of the dihydrogen molecule (?6.595eV) which is computed by considering a cubic supercell of lattice parameter 4.5A?.,contradiction
This value compares well with the literature value of ?6.650eV [37].,contradiction
"The obtained E coh magnitudes are such as ?0.099, ?0.301 and ?0.299eV for LaNi5H3, ?1 and ?2 models respectively.",contradiction
"The latter two values compare well with the heat of formation given by the literature which ranges from 0.332 to 0.363eV/mol H2 [38,39].",contradiction
As for the intermediate phase it is clear that hydrogen is less bound to the host lattice.,contradiction
This is relevant to the fact that it is (i) a hypothetic model and (ii) an intermediate phase which explains the formation of a saturated hydride where H is more bound.,contradiction
Nevertheless E coh values for the La2Ni10H6 models are ?0.218 and ?0.195eV for SGs P63mc and P6/mmm respectively.,contradiction
This provides an explanation for the cell doubling upon the uptake of more than one H per LaNi5.,contradiction
This cell doubling ensures a more bound H in the host lattice and the more negative energy for SG P63mc point to the contribution of the latter to the stability of the hydride phase.,contradiction
"In the following the intermediate model with SG P63mc, i.e. La2Ni10H6 (Z =1), will be considered for comparison with both LaNi5 and ?1(2) models.",contradiction
"On the other hand, calculations of the bulk modulus B0 are possible through E(V) curve fitting with a Birch 2nd order equation.",contradiction
"The obtained magnitudes are ? 134.9, 129.8, 122.9 and 122.7GPa for LaNi5, La2Ni10H6 (Z =1), ?1 and ?2 models respectively.",contradiction
"This is indicative of the larger compressibility of the hydride phase, with respect to LaNi5, under hydrostatic pressure.",contradiction
The magnitude of B0 decreases by ? 5 and 7GPa while passing from pure alloy to the saturated hydride through the intermediate hydride phase.,contradiction
This is related to volume expansion seen earlier.,contradiction
Recent calculations performed for B0 [40] resulted into a value of 126.4GPa for LaNi5 which is closer to the experiment (126.8GPa) [41] than the value reported herein.,entailment
In order to evaluate the ? phase SG we considered the relative energy ?E which is the difference between the equilibrium energies resulting from E(V) curves of both ?1 and ?2 models.,contradiction
?E favors the ?1 model by 0.015eV.,contradiction
This value is 1.5 times larger than the one given by previous calculations with a similar approach [36] which amounts to 10?2 eV in the favor of the ?2 model.,contradiction
Thus neither of the two SGs can be discarded by a PP approach which slightly favors the ?1 model in the present calculations.,contradiction
"From the non spin polarized (NSP) calculations and their analysis within the Stoner mean field theory of band ferromagnetism, it has been established that LaNi5 is unstable in such a configuration.",contradiction
"Consequently, SP calculations were carried out, assuming implicitly a hypothetic ferromagnetic order.",contradiction
"This is done by initially allowing for two different spin occupations, then the charges and the magnetic moments are self-consistently converged.",contradiction
The relative energy difference (?E = E(SP)?E(NSP)) for spin degenerate and SP calculations amounts to 0eV which is a first indication that there is no tendency for spin polarization.,contradiction
A simple model established by Malik et al. [43] around the magnetic structure of RCo5 (R=rare-earth) compounds in 1977 predicted that the three valence electrons of the rare-earth metal would fill up the holes in the ? -spin Ni 3d band.,contradiction
That would reduce the magnetic moment near to zero.,contradiction
Such calculations showed a transfer of only about one rare-earth electron in each case.,contradiction
A larger charge transfer to the extent of 1.5 electrons per lanthanum was noticed by the same authors [7] which resulted into a total moment of 0.69?B per formula unit (fu) almost entirely due to nickel as far as there was a zero moment induced at the lanthanum site.,contradiction
Thus the authors referred to LaNi5 as a ?very weak? ferromagnet with charge transfer and therefore an almost filled ? -spin band.,contradiction
"Within the current calculations, the VB configuration of the converged SP calculations for various atoms of LaNi5 is as follows:La:4f?0.244f?0.245d?0.955d?0.956s?0.276s?0.27Ni(2c):3d?4.273d?4.274s?0.324s?0.32Ni(3g):3d?4.253d?4.254s?0.344s?0.34It is clear from the outer electron configurations that the 6s bands of lanthanum as well as 4s nickel bands give away charges to the extent of ?1.5 and ?1.3 respectively.",contradiction
These are distributed among the other bands resulting into an equally filled ? and ? subbands.,contradiction
Further a small f character for La and a larger filling of La and Ni d states are noticed.,contradiction
So one can talk about a charge transfer between the different species which is depicted by the ELF mapping of Fig. 1(b) showing distorted pentagons.,contradiction
The equal occupation of subbands leads to a null total magnetic moment.,contradiction
This feature along with the instability of the NM configuration (Stoner criterion) is indicative of a paramagnetic ground state which agrees with the experiment.,contradiction
Another significant parameter can be extracted from the calculations and compared with the experiment namely the electronic specific-heat coefficient ? which is given by the following formula: ?=(2/3(?2kB2))žN(EF).,contradiction
The computed value of ? for LaNi5 is evaluated to be 23.12mJžK?2 žmol?1.,contradiction
"This is to be compared with the experimental values of 34.3 and 36.5mJžK?2 žmol?1 [46,47].",contradiction
The discrepancy from the experiment is ascribed to electron?phonon enhancement effects encountered by the experiment.,contradiction
Previous APW calculations [7] came with a good agreement to the experiment with a ? value to the extent of 32.4mJžK?2 žmol?1.,contradiction
More recent LMTO-ASA and FP-LMTO computations [8] obtained values such as 22.8 and 22.4mJžK?2 žmol?1.,contradiction
Neither experimental works nor the Stoner criterion for band ferromagnetism applied here pointed to a magnetic behavior of the saturated hydride system.,contradiction
Also SP calculations resulted into a null total magnetic moment.,contradiction
A need to check the magnetovolume effects relevant to volume expansion was answered by calculating two models at the saturated hydride volume and the SGs of both ?1 model and LaNi5 respectively.,contradiction
The second calculation was achieved by considering a large supercell along the c-axis in order to reduce any overlapping problems encountered with the expansion of a simple cell as far as the saturated hydride is described by a double cell (see Section 2).,contradiction
Both models converged to a large total magnetic moment amounting to ?3?B .,contradiction
"To explain the absence of such large magnetization within the hydride, the bonding between hydrogen and the different species is plotted in Fig. 5 .",contradiction
An analysis of the plotted curves shows that the dominant interactions are of bonding character and they lye in the energy region ranging from ?8 to ?4eV.,contradiction
"The most important interactions are seen between Ni1 and hydrogen which are relevant to the presence of Ni1 as a constituent of all H insertion holes, especially the tetrahedral site with H in the 6c position whereby Ni?H3 is the most bonding interaction.",contradiction
This meets with the ELF mapping in Fig. 1(a) where a strong localization is seen around H3.,contradiction
In this work hydrogen storage material LaNi5 and its saturated hydride have been theoretically investigated within DFT.,contradiction
"Hypothetic intermediate hydride models with SGs of both the pure alloy [LaNi5H3(Z =1), La2Ni10H6(Z =2)] and the saturated hydride [La2Ni10H6(Z =1)] were also computed.",contradiction
"Pending questions have been answered, relevant to (i) the SG of the saturated hydride as far as previous experimental works as well as theoretical computations could not rule out either two suggested symmetries, i.e. P63mc and P31c, (ii) the ground state of LaNi5 which was defined as paramagnetic by the experiment and ferromagnetic by theoretical computations and (iii) the interplay between the magnetovolume effects and the bonding of hydrogen in the host lattice.",contradiction
"PP calculations gave E(V) curves from which equilibrium quantities such as energies, volumes and bulk modulus were extracted.",contradiction
From the energy values it was shown that hydrogen is more bound in the lattice of the saturated hydride with respect to the intermediate hydride models.,contradiction
Further the hydrogen is more bound in a double cell such as La2Ni10H6 (Z =1) with respect to LaNi5H3 (Z =1) and La2Ni10H6 (Z =2).,contradiction
This provides an explanation of the cell doubling upon H uptake.,contradiction
Both saturated hydride models were examined resulting into a small total energy difference of 0.015eV which is not sufficient to discard either of the two SGs.,contradiction
The PP calculations were also used for geometry optimizations of the different models from which the input parameters to all-electrons ASW calculations were generated.,contradiction
"ASW computations defined, from the saturated hydride models energy difference of 1.65eV, P63mc as the most plausible SG.",contradiction
The use of the GGA approximation parameterized by Wu and Cohen resulted into a NM configuration pointing to a magnetic instability on the nickel 3g site.,contradiction
Subsequent SP computations converged into a null value for the total magnetic moment.,contradiction
These two features point that the ground state configuration for this pure alloy is between NM and ferromagnetic which is the paramagnetic order concomitant with the experiment.,contradiction
"Although volume expansion introduced by hydrogenation implies the onset of a total magnetic moment, the hydrogen binds with the different constituents, namely with nickel, to block this magnetization.",contradiction
This results into a NM saturated hydride system.,contradiction
"Since a non-noble metallic bulk glass alloy was firstly discovered by Inoue et al. [1], a number of stable metallic glass alloy systems with high glass-forming ability and lower critical cooling rates have been developed in the last 10 years.",contradiction
"These bulk glass alloys can be synthesized by conventional casting methods such as mold casting [2], high pressure die casting [3] and melt injection casting [4] to produce the bulk samples with three dimension sizes more than millimeters.",contradiction
"Among them, Zr-based bulk glass alloys are widely investigated because of their higher glass-forming ability and easy to synthesize larger size samples.",contradiction
"In the past decade, the bulk glass structure [5?8] and its mechanical properties [9?13] as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanism [6,9,14] for the formation of the bulk glass have been extensively studied.",contradiction
"The stability [15] and crystallization [16,17] of the bulk glass alloys have also been widely investigated.",contradiction
"However, owing to the fact that the decomposed microstructure for such a multicomponent bulk glass alloy is very complicated, the identification of all the phases and structures formed during crystallization is difficult.",contradiction
"As well known, bulk metallic glass alloys would usually decompose to a mixing structure of intermetallic compounds accompanying forming nanocrystalline or nanostructure phases by phase separation during annealing.",contradiction
"As early as 1978, Herold and Koster [18] classified the possible crystallization reactions in glasses as primary crystallization, polymorphic crystallization and eutectic crystallization.",contradiction
The Zr-based alloys with varieties of constituents may reveal different crystallized mechanism.,contradiction
"Tanner and Ray [19] found the phase separation in 1980 in Zr-Ti-Be ternary glass alloy after crystallization, to form uniform microstructure with second phase size of about 100?200 nm in quenched ribbon.",contradiction
"Molokanov et al. [20] studied the microstructural features of bulk glass Zr65Al7.5Cu17.5Ni10 alloy to find that some sphere-like crystals frozen into the amorphous matrix are the intermetallics of Zr2Cu, Zr2Ni, Zr3Al, and some unidentified phases, and found two-stage crystallization from DSC curves by continuous heating the quenched ribbons.",contradiction
"In the first stage, a metastable fcc-phase forms with cell size a=1.243 nm, and then decays to form more complicated precipitations, but they did not identify the final stable phases.",contradiction
"In their consequent paper [17], they pointed out that the structure of the Zr-based alloy consists of Zr2Cu and Zr2Ni, even ZrO2 after full isothermal crystallization.",contradiction
"Xing et al. [16] suggested a tendency of phase separation in bulk glass Zr57Ti5Al10Cu20Ni8 alloy, but had not identified the sequential crystal phases and the phase size.",contradiction
"Lin et al. [21] investigated the effect of oxygen impurity on crystallization of an undercooled bulk glass forming Zr52.5Ti5Ni14.6Cu17.9Al10 alloy, found that the oxygen content strongly affects the crystallization incubation time due to the oxide or oxygen stabilized phases acting as heterogeneous nucleation sites during the transition of liquid to solid.",contradiction
"Such sites must exist in sequent bulk glass matrix in forms of ?quenched-in nuclei?, and must play an important role in crystallization of the bulk glass alloys.",contradiction
"Many Zr-based bulk glass alloys can be easily cast into 3?16 mm diameter rods or 1?4 mm thick sheets, so that the mechanical properties of the glass state samples have been comprehensively characterized.",contradiction
"Inoue et al. [9] tested the tensile properties of Zr60Al10Co3Ni9Cu18 bulk glass alloy with the results of 97 GPa in Young?s modulus, 1.51 GPa in tensile fracture strength and 2.0% in fracture elongation.",contradiction
Their tensile testing exhibits distinct serrated flow due to the ductile nature of the alloy.,contradiction
"Bruck et al. [22] characterized the mechanical properties of Zr41.25Ti13.75Ni10Cu12.5Be22.5 and Zr65Al7.5Ni10Cu17.5 bulk glass alloys by tension, compression and torsion tests.",contradiction
Their results showed excellent tensile properties for the quinary alloy with a yield strength up to 1.9 GPa and an elastic strain of about 2.0%.,contradiction
They found that the deformation behavior of the quaternary alloy is not much different from that of Be-bearing quinary alloy.,contradiction
Liu et al. [13] characterized the mechanical properties of Zr55Al10Ni5Cu30 and Zr52.5Ti5Ni14.6Cu17.9Al10 bulk glass alloys in different test environment.,contradiction
"The fracture strength of the quaternary alloy is in the range from 1.21 to 1.64 GPa, and corresponding fracture strains in the range from 1.33 to 1.63%.",contradiction
"For the quinary alloy, the fracture strength and the fracture strain are in the range of 1.65?1.75 GPa and 1.8?2.0%, respectively.",contradiction
The properties for both of the Zr-based alloys do not reveal distinct difference in various test environment.,contradiction
"More recently, the mechanical properties of bulk glass alloys are investigated to reveal that the full glass alloys with excellent ductility become very brittle after partial or full crystallization [23?26].",contradiction
"On other hand, the crystalline phases on glass samples can already form during casting due to nucleation caused by impurities, e.g. oxides, or due to insufficient cooling rate upon quenching.",contradiction
"Such quenched-in crystallites also give rise to brittleness [25,27,28].",contradiction
"An important fact is noted that the as-cast composite microstructures have micrometer-sized crystals in a glass matrix, which causes significantly reduced ductility even for very few volume fractions of the quenched-in crystallites.",contradiction
"But, the crystallites formed by crystallization of glass have nanoscale-size, and cause brittleness only for larger volume fractions of nanocrystals.",contradiction
"Furthermore, Xing et al. [26] found that the fracture stress and the Young?s modulus for Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 alloy increased with the crystallized fraction to 45% and then decreased.",contradiction
Kato and Inoue [27] also found that the Young?s modulus and Vickers hardness for Zr55Al10Ni5Cu30 glass alloy containing ZrC particles increased almost linearly with increasing the particle volume fraction from 0 to 17%.,contradiction
"Doglione et al. [23], and Gilbert et al. [24] found that the hardness increased with an increasing amount of nanocrystalline phase in Zr-Ti-Ni-Cu-Be bulk glass alloys.",contradiction
"In this paper, the bulk glass state Zr52.5Ni14.6Al10Cu17.9Ti5 alloy with a diameter of 6 mm is prepared by melt injection casting.",contradiction
The structure evolution of the bulk glass alloy after annealing is investigated.,contradiction
"For evaluating the mechanical properties of the crystallized microstructure, the compressive deformation behavior and microhardness for various microstructure are tested by Nano-indenter II.",contradiction
The elastic modulus for the alloy is extrapolated from the deformation behavior.,contradiction
The relation of the mechanical properties to the structure is established.,contradiction
The Zr-based alloy with a nominal composition of Zr52.5Ni14.6Al10Cu17.9Ti5 (at.,contradiction
"percent) (developed by Lin et al. [21] in 1997) was pre-alloyed by melting appropriate amounts of pure metal elements: Ni, Cu, Al and Ti, together with sponge zirconium (containing less than 175 appm O) to cast into ingots with 12 mm diameter.",contradiction
"These master ingots then were surface-polished and followed by induction?melted inside quartz tubes at the temperature above 1200 K under argon atmosphere, and then injected into copper mold to form bulk glass samples with a diameter of 6 mm.",contradiction
All the samples were examined by X-ray diffractometry to determine their states.,contradiction
Only the samples with complete glass state were used in the following experiments.,contradiction
"The melting temperature (T m), glass transition temperature (T g) and crystallization temperature (T x) for Zr52.5Ni14.6Al10Cu17.9Ti5 alloy were determined by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis at different heating rates.",contradiction
The annealing temperature was chosen in the range from below T x to above T x.,contradiction
Annealing processing was conducted in an induction heating furnace under argon atmosphere.,contradiction
Then the annealed samples were sectioned for microstructural analysis.,contradiction
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for the analysis of the microstructure of the annealed samples.,contradiction
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the structure and phase transformation.,contradiction
The XRD was performed on the surface-polished of unetched samples using Cu K? radiation.,contradiction
The samples for SEM observation were etched in a solution of 4 ml HF+40 ml HNO3+25 g CrO3+70 ml H2O.,contradiction
The samples used for TEM were mechanically thinned and chemically polished in a solution of 33% nitric acid and 67% methanol in volume at the temperature of 250 K.,contradiction
The compressive deformation behavior in micro-scale and microhardness for the crystallized microstructures were evaluated by Nanoindenter II.,contradiction
The elastic moduli for various microstructures were extrapolated from the deformation behavior.,contradiction
Some important parameters are listed below: the Poisson?s ration of the indenter is 0.07; the modulus of the indenter is 1141 GPa; the Poisson?s ratio of the samples is taken to be 0.25 in calculation of the elastic modulus and microhardness; and the size of the spot compressed by Indenter is about ten times of the displacement.,contradiction
"Tm, Tg and T x are determined to be 1106.33, 630.61 and 709.90 K, respectively, by DTA at the heating rate of 0.167 K/s, and DSC at the heating rate of 0.333 K/s for Zr52.5Ni14.6Al10Cu17.9Ti5 alloy [29].",contradiction
"Compared with the reported results [21], the T m of 1106.33 K is about 37 K higher, and the T g of 630.61 K is about 50?60 K lower.",contradiction
This difference is mainly due to the different contents of oxygen and other impurities which entered the alloy from raw materials or the environment atmosphere in the processing.,contradiction
Our alloy is chemically analyzed to contain oxygen in the level of 706 ppm (atomic concentration).,contradiction
Such a high level of oxygen results in the formation of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 compound during annealing.,contradiction
"Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the bulk glass, partly crystallized and fully crystallized structures developed at various annealed temperatures.",contradiction
"From which one can find that only a part of glass alloy crystallized after annealed at below T x (673 K) for 600 s, but almost completely crystallized after annealed at T x and above T x (703?723 K) for 600 s.",contradiction
"The crystallization is difficult at below T x, because of the small driving force in the systematic energy and hardly atom diffusing.",contradiction
"The predominant crystalline phase is originated from the complexes or quenched-in nuclei in the bulk glass alloy which formed when the liquid alloy was frozen into glass [7,8], and acts as heterogeneous nucleation sites during annealing.",contradiction
"These predominant crystals are determined to be Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni, and distributed uniformly on the glass matrix as shown in Fig. 2 (a).",contradiction
The oxygen dissolved into the alloy from the raw materials and the protected atmosphere is detected in substituting Ni atoms in Zr2Ni compound.,contradiction
"After annealed at temperature near T x, the already existed phases of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni with small size grow and join together to form net-shape phase of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni in the glass matrix.",contradiction
"The other glass matrix separated by the net-shape phase transforms into Zr2Ni, Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 in sequence.",contradiction
"These phases are determined by XRD patterns, and are proved by structure analysis by TEM (the detail will be reported in a sequential paper).",contradiction
"The crystallized microstructure seems to like a uniform structure with a grain size of about 25 ?m, as shown in Fig. 2(b).",contradiction
"Increasing the annealing temperature up to 723 K, the crystalline phases and microstructure have not been found to obvious change, but the amounts of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 relatively increase based on the XRD patterns.",contradiction
"Fig. 3 (a?c) reveals the formation of the net-shape Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni phases, it seems that the net-shape phases increase and become continuous with increasing annealing temperatures from 723 to 823 K, the size of the matrix phase separated by the net-shape phase is from about 20 ?m at 723 K to about 15 ?m at 823 K.",contradiction
"Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns for the bulk glass alloy annealed for 600 s at 753, 773 and 823 K, respectively, on which two phenomenons can be found, one is that the amounts of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds increase because their diffraction peaks become strong, and the other is that the diffraction peaks for Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds broaden because of the formation of nanostructure with increasing annealing temperature by phase separation.",contradiction
The nucleation and crystal growth for Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 need long-term diffusion of Al and Cu atoms which is mainly controlled by temperature [5].,contradiction
"At high temperatures, Al and Cu atoms diffuse easily, thus to increase amounts of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds in the crystallized microstructure.",contradiction
"Related the XRD patterns to their microstructures, it can be found that the formation of Zr2Ni accompanies the formation of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds by phase separation, which leads to the formation of nanostructure composed of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 phases with a size less than 100 nm distributed on the matrix of Zr2Ni shown in Fig. 5 .",contradiction
"Fig. 6 is the relation of the load to the displacement tested by Nanoindenter on the microstructure of bulk glass Zr52.5Ni14.6Al10Cu17.9Ti5 alloy after annealing at different temperatures, by which the compressive strains decrease with changing the microstructure from glass state to crystalline and nanostructure, that implies that the deformation resistance and microhardness become larger for crystalline structure and nanostructure than glass structure.",contradiction
Fig. 7 shows the elastic moduli for the crystallized microstructure and nanostructure evaluated by Nanoindenter.,contradiction
"The nano-scale phase sizes formed at different annealing temperatures is also shown in Fig. 7, on which the bulk glass alloy has a lower elastic modulus, with the formation of crystalline and nanostructure their elastic moduli becomes larger.",contradiction
"The nano-scale phase sizes formed by phase separation are strongly dependent on the annealing temperature, with increasing annealing temperature the nano-scale phase sizes decrease sharply.",contradiction
It is interesting to note that the elastic modulus of the bulk glass alloy evaluated by Nanoindenter is only half of that tested on bulk specimens [13].,contradiction
That may be because the Nanoindenter evaluates the elastic modulus by extrapolation of the compressive deformation behavior in micro-scale.,contradiction
But the difference between the two deformation mechanism is unknown.,contradiction
"Fig. 8 is the plot of microhardness evaluated by Nanoindenter to annealing temperature, by which the bulk glass structure is relative soft, with the formation of crystalline and nanostructure, the microstructures become harder.",contradiction
The structure evolution of bulk glass Zr52.5Ni14.6Al10Cu17.9Ti5 alloy can be identified in three kinds of phase transformations.,contradiction
"Firstly, only small predominant crystal phases form in the glass matrix, this transformation takes place at lower temperatures, e.g. annealing at 673 K far below T x.",contradiction
The predominant crystalline nucleates and grows by joining together of the complexes or quenched-in nuclei by shear deformation of the lattice [30?32].,contradiction
"The oxygen that entered the alloy may couple with other metal elements to form complexes of stable oxides or compounds resulting in forming quenched-in nuclei in the bulk glass alloy, and may act as the nucleation sites of the predominant crystalline.",contradiction
"The formation of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni compounds does not need long-term diffusion of Ni atoms which is proved by the radial distribution functions for Zr atom indicating that the atomic fraction of Ni in the nearest neighbors around Zr does not change after annealing at different temperatures [5,33], so that the nucleation and growth of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni compounds arise relative small changes in systematic energy and interfacial energy between glass phase and Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 or Zr2Ni phase.",contradiction
"On the other hand, the structure of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 or Zr2Ni with a highly degree of dense packed state is very close to the dense random packed structure of the glass phase, that results in lower activation energy for nucleation of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 or Zr2Ni and in favour of crystallization for Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 or Zr2Ni compounds.",contradiction
"Secondly, the glass phase almost fully transforms into crystalline after annealed at T x to above T x for 600 s.",contradiction
The predominant phases of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni join together to form net-shape phase.,contradiction
The glass matrix transforms into Zr2Ni and a small amount of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds.,contradiction
"But, most of Al and Cu atoms are dissolved in Zr2Ni, because the diffusion of Al and Cu atoms and the nucleation of Zr-Al and Zr-Cu compounds are difficult at this temperature range.",contradiction
"Finally, at annealing temperatures far above T x, the long-term diffusion and rearrangement of Al and Cu atoms become possible, that results in the formation of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds by phase separation.",contradiction
Such phase formation sequence is consistent with the results in quaternary Zr-based alloy [20].,contradiction
"The formation of nanostructure is because the nucleation rate for Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds is very large when the temperature increases enough to overcome the nucleation obstruction, but the growth rate is restrained by the lattice frame of Zr2Ni and Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 phases.",contradiction
"Table 1 summarizes the structures, sizes of crystallized phases and nanostructure phases and the elastic moduli and microhardness of different crystallized microstructures for bulk glass Zr52.5Ni14.6Al10Cu17.9Ti5 alloy.",contradiction
"With increasing annealed temperatures from 753 to 823 K, the sizes of phases formed by phase separation significantly decrease resulting from the easily nucleation for Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds.",contradiction
The elastic modulus for the bulk glass Zr52.5Ni14.6Al10Cu17.9Ti5 alloy is in the level of 40 GPa much smaller than steel or most pure metals.,entailment
"This value of modulus is coherent with the small deformation resistance of glass phase resulting from no grain boundary and no work hardening during deformation, and indicates that high values of elastic energy can be stored in the materials.",contradiction
But 40 GPa is only half of the Young?s modulus tested on bulk specimens [13].,contradiction
This difference is now not understood.,contradiction
"At annealing temperature of 673 K, although crystalline forms in a small amount of volumes, it is distributed uniformly in all microstructures to strengthen the composite microstructure, thus the elastic modulus grows up to 113.87 GPa.",contradiction

"Hydration is expected to alter the thickness and depth of the olivine to wadsleyite phase transition (e.g., (Wood, 1995; Chen et al., 2002; Smyth and Frost, 2002)), promote partial melting (Hirschmann, 2006), and alter rheological and transport properties (Chen et al., 1998; Huang et al., 2005; Karato, 2006).",contradiction

"The cause of monoclinic symmetry in hydrous wadsleyite remains unresolved, but it has been speculated to result from cation vacancy ordering (Smyth et al., 1997), stacking disorder of distinct structural modules (Kudoh and Inoue, 1999), or polysynthetic twinning (Holl et al., in press).",contradiction
"Among six hydrous wadsleyite runs studied by Jacobsen et al. (2005), only samples with water contents greater than about 0.5 wt.% H2O displayed the monoclinic symmetry.",contradiction
"In this study, samples from run WH833 are orthorhombic with average ? =90.002(3)ø (Jacobsen et al., 2005).",contradiction
Samples from run WH2120 display a slight monoclinic distortion with average ? =90.044(5)ø.,contradiction

"The concentration of hydroxyl (OH) in hydrous wadsleyite is commonly reported in wt.% H2O or parts per million by weight (ppm wt), where 1 wt.% H2O=10,000 ppm wt H2O.",contradiction
Estimating the water contents is problematic because an absolute calibration for OH specific to wadsleyite has not been established for either spectroscopic (IR) or secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).,contradiction
"Polarized Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to estimate the water content of sample WH833 using the calibration of Libowitzky and Rossman (1997), resulting in 0.37 wt.% as the sum from polarized measurements with E//a, E//b, and E//c (Jacobsen et al., 2005).",contradiction
Spectra for sample WH833 with E//b are shown in Fig. 1 .,contradiction
"Polarized IR spectra for samples WH2120 and SS0401 are also shown in Fig. 1, and illustrate the typical problem of using IR to study wadsleyite.",contradiction
"Namely, the dominant absorption band pair at 3300?3400 cm?1 cannot be resolved because of the high-water content (>0.5 wt.%) in these samples.",contradiction
"The spectra in Fig. 1 were obtained from 30-micron thick plates, but the use of thinner plates measuring ?10 ?m thickness for SS0401 also resulted in complete absorption at 3300?3400 cm?1.",contradiction
"Therefore, the relationship between the b/a axial ratio and estimated water content from Jacobsen et al. (2005) was used to calculate the water content of WH2120 and SS0401.",contradiction
"This relationship, b/a =2.008+1.25ž10?6 C H2O (in ppm wt) uses water contents from IR at lower concentrations and SIMS data at higher concentrations.",contradiction
The correlation uses b/a because the b axis of wadsleyite increases systematically with water content and the a axis decreases systematically with increasing water content.,contradiction
"Although there is also a clear positive volume of hydration (i.e. volume increases with water content), by using b/a individual measurements are not subject to absolute uncertainty in the volume, which may vary from one diffractometer to another.",contradiction
The b/a relationship results in 0.84 wt.% H2O for sample WH2120 and 1.66 wt.% H2O for SS0401.,contradiction
Water contents for all samples studied by Brillouin spectroscopy in this study are listed in Table 1.,contradiction
"Because there is no absolute calibration for water in wasleyite, we have chosen to use arbitrary 10% error bars in subsequent figures and in calculation of density.",contradiction
Measured unit cell volumes and water contents were used to calculate the variation of density (Fig. S1 in the Appendix).,contradiction
A nominally anhydrous sample (WS3056) containing about 50 ppm wt H2O with ? calc =3.472(1) g/cm3 from the study of Jacobsen et al. (2005) is used for comparison.,contradiction

"Formula weights were calculated according to the stoichiometry Mg2? x H2x SiO4, where 2x was determined as discussed in Section 2.2 and full Si occupancy is assumed.",contradiction

Raman spectra were measured for all samples at ambient conditions.,contradiction
Up to 22 Raman modes were observed for a given sample (Fig. S2 in the Appendix).,contradiction
"The peak positions obtained for the sample with 1.66 wt.% H2O are generally in good agreement with a previous study (Kleppe et al., 2001) which had a nearly identical water content.",contradiction
"In the range 200?1100 cm?1, most of modes show a subtle decrease in frequency with water content.",contradiction
Lattice mode frequencies typically decrease by ?3 cm?1 from nominally anhydrous wadsleyite to samples with 1.66 wt.% H2O.,contradiction
We also observed three OH modes for each composition (Table S1 in the Appendix).,contradiction
"Compared with (Kleppe et al., 2001), our OH modes occur at slightly lower frequencies.",contradiction
"For the OH doublet at 3321 cm?1 and 3582 cm?1, the frequency increases by 7.4 cm?1 and 8.8 cm?1 respectively from 0.37 to 1.66 wt.% H2O.",contradiction
The frequency increases by 2.6 cm?1 for the 3582 cm?1 mode over the range of water content.,contradiction
"Thus, water has a weak but detectable effect on Raman frequencies, with lattice modes generally decreasing and OH modes increasing as a function of H2O content.",contradiction
"Although some of our samples display a slightly monoclinic distortion which would require characterization of 13 elastic constants, the Brillouin data were fitted assuming orthorhombic symmetry because the angular deviation from 90ø is small (see Section 2.1).",contradiction
"In this case, nine independent elastic constants are needed to characterize each sample.",contradiction
"The orientation of each platelet can be described by three Eulerian angles (?, ?, ?) that relate the laboratory coordinate system to the crystal coordinate system (Shimisu, 1995).",contradiction
"The Eulerian angles together with an azimuthal angle determine the phonon propagation direction which can be expressed by the direction cosines, ni .",contradiction
"In total, there are 9+3k unknown parameters (9 elastic constants, k platelets, 3k Eulerian angles).",contradiction
"These were obtained by fitting the velocity data for all platelets of a given composition simultaneously using Christoffel's equation (Every, 1980):3det|Cijklnjnl???2?ik|=0 where, ? is the density, ? is the phonon velocity, ni are the direction cosines of the phonon propagation direction, and the Cijkl are the elastic constants in full suffix notation.",contradiction
"The velocity data were inverted using the non-linear least-squares Levenberg?Marquardt method (Press et al., 1988).",contradiction
"Orientations of some platelets (6 out of 10 total) were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction at the X17C beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Hu et al., 1993) and/or the Mineral Structures Laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder.",contradiction
"The starting values used for the non-linear least-squares inversion were the elastic constants of anhydrous wadsleyite (Sawamoto et al., 1984; Zha et al., 1997) and the subset of crystal orientations measured by X-ray diffraction.",contradiction
"Table S2 in the Appendix shows the best-fitting Cij values where the compact Voigt notation (Nye, 1985) for the elastic tensor is adopted.",contradiction
The uncertainty of the recovered Eulerain angles is typically within ñ2ø.,contradiction
The difference between the recovered and initial X-ray crystal orientations is also 2ø on average but can be as large as 5ø.,contradiction
Some uncertainty is likely introduced due to the remounting of the assembly holding the crystal platelets between the X-ray and Brillouin measurement.,contradiction
"In addition, covariance among the Eulerain angles for a given plane may also contribute to uncertainty in recovered orientations.",contradiction
Fig. 3 shows the experimentally obtained velocity data together with values calculated from the best-fitting elastic constants for WH833 with 0.37 wt.% H2O.,contradiction
"For WH2021 and SS0401, results are presented in Fig. S3.",contradiction
The root-mean-square (RMS) deviation (Table S2 in the Appendix) between measured and calculated acoustic velocities ranges from 39 m/s to 51 m/s.,contradiction
This indicates excellent agreement between the measured and calculated acoustic velocities.,contradiction

"Linear fits to the Cij values including nominally anhydrous compositions (Sawamoto et al., 1984; Zha et al., 1997) as a function of H2O content are shown by the solid lines.",contradiction
"Longitudinal moduli C11, C22, C33, shear modulus, C44, and off-diagonal modulus, C23, display a well-defined linear decrease with H2O content.",contradiction
"Due largely to the difference between anhydrous elastic constants of Sawamoto et al. (1984) and Zha et al. (1997), the trends for C55, C66, C12, and C13 are less certain.",contradiction
C23 is the elastic modulus most strongly affected by incorporation of water.,contradiction
It decreases 20% from 0% to 1.66 wt.% H2O.,contradiction
"On the other hand, C12 only shows a weak dependence on water content.",contradiction
"The longitudinal (C11, C22, C33) and shear (C44, C55, C66) moduli all show similar decreases with water content.",contradiction
"The covariance matrix was calculated to evaluate the trade-off among recovered pairs of elastic constants (Press et al., 1988; Brown et al., 1996).",contradiction
"In general, trade-off coefficients for longitudinal and shear moduli are small and indicate the elastic moduli are well-resolved.",contradiction
C12 is the most poorly constrained elastic modulus.,contradiction
"For sample WH833 (0.37 wt.% H2O), C12 shows strongest dependence on the value of C11, C22, C33, and C66.",contradiction
"For sample WH2120 (0.84 wt.% H2O), C12 depends on the value of C13, C22, C33 and C66.",contradiction
"The trade-off between C11 and C66, C33 and C66 for sample WH833, C11 and C12, C23 and C66, C23 and C13 for sample WH2120 are also greater than average.",contradiction
"The crystal orientations sampled for WH833 (0.37 wt.% H2O) are relatively deficient in directions normal to the c axis, and this may be responsible for some of the scatter in individual Cij s (Fig. 4).",contradiction
"Nevertheless, aggregate moduli obtained from the single-crystal elastic constants are likely well determined because trade-off errors tend to cancel during averaging (Zha et al., 1996).",contradiction
Fig. 8 summarizes existing data on the bulk and shear moduli of olivine polymorphs as a function of density at ambient conditions.,contradiction
The figure focuses mainly on single-crystal data.,contradiction
The density increase for a given polymorph (solid lines in Fig. 8) reflects incorporations of iron along the solid solution.,contradiction
The shear modulus for all the three phases shows a monotonic decrease with density.,contradiction
The bulk modulus for both olivine and ringwoodite increases weakly with density following similar trends.,contradiction

Incorporating water produces a change in density and mean atomic weight without a major structure change.,contradiction
It is clear from Fig. 8 that hydrous olivine polymorphs tend to follow the structural trend (dashed lines) indicated in the figure.,contradiction

"The extrapolated shear modulus for anhydrous wadsleyite is consistent with or slightly lower than previous values (Sawamoto et al., 1984; Zha et al., 1997; Liu et al., 2005).",contradiction
"According to (4) and (5), 1 wt.% H2O corresponds to a 7.6% decrease in KS 0 and a 7.0% decrease in G 0.",contradiction
"Using available data for other olivine polymorphs and assuming a linear relationship between aggregate elastic moduli and water content, the effect of H2O on olivine and ringwoodite can also be estimated.",contradiction

"Thus, at least for Fe-free compositions, incorporation of water appears to have greater effect on the bulk and shear moduli of wadsleyite than for olivine and ringwoodite.",contradiction
"For density, 1 wt.% H2O in wadsleyite leads to a 1.3% decrease in density.",contradiction
The olivine to wadsleyite phase transition is generally accepted as the main source of the 410-km seismic discontinuity in the mantle.,contradiction
"Seismic studies typically show about a 5?6% increase in density and a 4?6% increase in seismic velocity across this boundary (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981; Grand and Helmberger, 1984; Mechie et al., 1993; Kennett et al., 1995).",contradiction
"At ambient conditions, the velocity contrast between anhydrous olivine and wadsleyite is 12?13% (Sawamoto et al., 1984).",contradiction
"If such a velocity contrast persisted to 410-km depth, the corresponding olivine fraction needed to produce a velocity jump that will match seismic data would be about ?40% (Sawamoto et al., 1984; Duffy et al., 1995).",contradiction
Petrological models of the mantle often favor an olivine-rich composition (?60% by vol.) for the upper mantle.,contradiction
"For such a composition to satisfy seismic data, the velocity contrast between olivine and wadsleyite should be only about 6.7?8.3%.",contradiction
"In detail, mineralogical modeling of the 410-km discontinuity requires taking into account relative changes in velocity with P and T, Fe distribution between olivine and wadsleyite, presence of other phases, etc (Duffy and Anderson, 1989; Duffy et al., 1995; Liu et al., 2005).",contradiction
"Even with such effects, hydration of wadsleyite has frequently been invoked to reconcile the seismic properties at 410-km depth and mineral physics data for olivine polymorphs with an olivine-rich mantle (Sawamoto et al., 1984; Chambers et al., 2005).",contradiction
"Using our new elasticity data together with that of Jacobsen et al. (2006), we can now directly quantify the effect of H2O on the velocity contrast between olivine and wadsleyite.",contradiction
Seismic velocities were calculated for the simple case of an Fe-free system at ambient conditions and the velocity contrast between olivine and wadsleyite is plotted as a function of water content in wadsleyite and olivine in Fig. 6 .,contradiction
Results for compressional and shear waves are similar.,contradiction
The presence of 1.1?1.4 wt.% H2O in wadsleyite can reduce the velocity contrast to 7?8% if olivine is anhydrous.,contradiction
"Alternatively, if the H2O content of olivine is 0.8 wt.%, then an H2O content in wadsleyite of 1.3?1.8% is needed to reduce the velocity contrast to 7?8%.",contradiction
"Recent studies have estimated that the wadsleyite/forsterite H2O partition coefficient is in the range of 2?5 under mantle conditions (Chen et al., 2002; Hirschmann et al., 2005; Frost and Dolejs?, 2007).",contradiction
Values of the velocity contrast between wadsleyite and olivine are indicated for this range of partitioning values in Fig. 6.,contradiction

"These results indicate that the presence of H2O can affect not only the thickness of the 410-km discontinuity (Chen et al., 2002; Hirschmann et al., 2005; Frost and Dolejs?, 2007) but also the magnitude of the velocity change between the two phases.",contradiction
"However, water contents must approach expected saturation values in order for the effects of water to reduce the velocity contrast at 410 km to the values required to match an olivine-rich (pyrolite) mantle.",contradiction
"The isothermal bulk modulus, KT , was calculated from our measured adiabatic bulk modulus, KS , using:6KT=KS/(1+??T) where T is temperature, ? is thermal expansion coefficient (Inoue et al., 2004) and ? is the Gruneisen parameter (assumed to be identical to anhydrous wadsleyite (Chopelas, 1991)).",contradiction

"It is notable that other static compression studies on hydrous olivine polymorphs (Smyth et al., 2004, 2005; Manghnani et al., 2005) suggest high H2O contents lead to an increase of K?T 0.",contradiction

A method has been developed to obtain an equation of state for ionic solids starting from the theory of interionic potentials and using analytical functions for the volume dependence of the short-range force constant.,contradiction
The expressions are also obtained for isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives.,contradiction
Numerical analysis is presented for a NaCl crystal up to 30 GPa.,contradiction
The results are compared with the available experimental data.,contradiction
The variation of the pressure derivative of bulk modulus with pressure has also been studied using the formulation recently developed by Stacey.,contradiction
The study of temperature dependence of volume thermal expansion is of current interest since an adequate knowledge about it is necessary for understanding the high-temperature behavior of solids [1].,contradiction
There have been continuous efforts to study the temperature dependence of thermal expansion for ionic solids at high temperatures [2].,contradiction
"Recently, several expressions for the temperature dependence of thermal expansion of ionic solids have been developed: Shanker et al. [3,4] presented a formulation based on the power series expansion of lattice potential energy extending the method originally due to Born and Huang [1]; Pandey [5] developed an expression using the assumption that the coefficient of volume thermal expansion ? is a quadratic function of temperature; Singh and Chauhan [2] put forward a relation based on the modification of the expression given by Anderson [6] for linear variation of ? with temperature at higher temperatures; and Kushwah et al. [7] obtained a relation on the basis of the two assumptions that the product of the coefficient of volume thermal expansion ? and the isothermal bulk modulus KT is constant and the Chopelas?Boehler approximation, i.e., the isothermal Anderson?Gruneisen parameter varies linearly with temperature, holds.",contradiction
"In this paper, a new relation based on the diffusional driving force models reported in the literature for predicting volume thermal expansion of alkali halides under the effect of high temperature is developed.",contradiction
"In 1987, Bosi [8] presented a model for predicting the melting temperature of alkali halides using the concept of a diffusional driving force given by(1)Fr=T(dSdr)T,where S is entropy, T is temperature, and r is the distance between particles.",contradiction
"After Bosi, Sharma and Sharma [9] and Singh [10] presented, respectively, two different diffusional driving force models.",contradiction
The two models relate the diffusional driving force with the interparticle separation for a given temperature.,contradiction
"It has been shown [9,10] that, with the same Born inverse power potential function, the melting temperature of alkali halides obtained from either of the two diffusional force models are in good agreement with the experimental data.",contradiction
"Hence, it is reasonable to think the two diffusional driving forces are equivalent.",contradiction
The purpose of the present work is to demonstrate that on the basis of this assumption a simple relation would be yielded for determining the variation of volume of alkali halides from room temperature to near their melting temperatures.,contradiction
"In Section 2, the method of analysis will be described.",contradiction
"And in Section 3, the predicted values of V/V 0 of NaCl and KCl crystals from room temperature to temperatures close to their melting points are calculated with this developed relation; the calculated results given by this relation and the other similar expressions are compared with the experimental data.",contradiction
"Finally, in Section 4, the applicability of the relation presented here for the volume thermal expansion of alkali halides as well as some thermodynamic relationships included in its derivation is discussed.",contradiction
"The expression for the diffusional driving force Fr given by Bosi with Eq. (1) is(2)Fr=2kBT/r,where k B is the Boltzmann constant and r is the interparticle separation at temperature T.",contradiction
"Sharma and Sharma [9] thought that Bosi's diffusional driving force model, i.e. Eq. (2), seems to be unjustified because only attractive Coulombian force alone is taken into account in the derivation.",contradiction
"Thus, they [9] modified the diffusional driving force as(3)Fr=2CkBT/r,where C is a characteristic constant which takes care of not only Coulombian attractive force between the two particles (cation and anion) of the alkali halide under study, but also finite repulsive and van der Waals forces between them.",contradiction
"However, very recently, Singh [10] suggested another different expression for the diffusional driving force existing in ionic material with NaCl structure as follows:(4)Fr=6r2T?KT.Expression (4) is derived from Eq. (1) with the help of the following Maxwell's thermodynamic relations:(5)(dSdV)T=(dPdT)V=?KT,and the relationship V=2r3 for crystals with NaCl structure, where V is the volume and P the pressure.",contradiction
"Assuming that the above two diffusional driving force models, i.e. Eqs. (3) and (4), are equivalent, we get (6)?KT=C0/V,where the constant C0=2CKB/3.",contradiction
"Using the definition of thermal expansivity ?,?=1V(dVdT)P,in relation (6), we get the following differential equation:(7)dVdT=C0KT.For integrating Eq. (7) along an isobar, we require a knowledge of the temperature dependence of isothermal bulk modulus.",contradiction
"In this paper, the following linear relationship for the variation of isothermal bulk modulus KT with temperature T is taken:(8)KT=KT0[1-?0?0(T-T0)],where ?0, KT 0, and ?0 are, respectively, the isothermal Anderson?Gruneisen parameter, the isothermal bulk modulus, and the thermal expansivity all at room temperature T0=300K and zero pressure.",contradiction
It has been shown [11?13] that relation (8) is a good approximation for solids at higher temperatures.,contradiction
"Substituting Eq. (8) into (7) and taking into account that the constant C 0 may be written as C0=?0KT0V0 in terms of relation (6), we get the following expression for the temperature dependence of volume thermal expansion of alkali halides by integrating Eq. (7) over temperature at ambient pressure (P=0):(9)VV0=1-1?0ln[1-?0?0(T-T0)],where V 0 is the volume at the reference temperature T 0.",contradiction
"In order to examine the validity of Eq. (9), we now calculate the values of V/V 0 as a function of temperature for NaCl and KCl crystals.",contradiction
"The input parameters, which are required for the calculation, are ?0 and ?0.",contradiction
These values are available from the literature [14] and listed in Table 1 .,contradiction
The calculated results for NaCl and KCl crystals with Eq. (9) from room temperature to that close to the melting temperatures are reported in Tables 2 and 3 .,contradiction
"For comparison, the experimental data reported by Anderson [6] and Corish et al. [15] are also listed in Tables 2 and 3.",contradiction
It is of interest to compare relation (9) with the other similar relations reported in the literature for the temperature dependence of volume thermal expansion of alkali halides.,contradiction
"Of the four relations mentioned previously, only the two relations presented, respectively, by Shanker et al. [3,4] and Kushwah et al. [7] can be used directly for the calculation because of no fitting parameters in them, which is the same as Eq. (9).",contradiction
"Hence, the calculated results reported by Kushwah and Shanker [4] with the following expression(10)VV0=1-[1-2(KT0?+1)KT0PTH]1/2KT0?+1+1,and obtained from the relation suggested by Kushwah et al. [7] in the following form,(11)VV0=1-1?0+1ln[1-?0(?0+1)(T-T0)],are all presented in Tables 2 and 3 for the sake of comparison.",contradiction
"In Eq. (10), KT0? is the first-order pressure derivative of KT 0 at P=0, and P TH is the thermal pressure given by(12)PTH=?0KT0(T-T0).",contradiction
"Tables 2 and 3 clearly shows that when the temperature is not too high from room temperature, the calculated results obtained from any of the three equations for volume thermal expansion of NaCl and KCl crystals agree with the experimental data well, but at higher temperatures, the results obtained from Eq. (9) present better agreement with the experimental ones compared with those from Eqs. (10) and (11).",contradiction
"Especially beyond the range of temperature reported by Anderson [6], the values of V/V 0 for NaCl and KCl up to temperatures near their melting points given by Eq. (9) are in excellent agreement with the corresponding values reported by Corish et al. [15].",contradiction
"(1) The tests and comparisons presented above, demonstrate that relation (9) is very suitable for describing the temperature dependence of volume thermal expansion for NaCl and KCl crystals from room temperature up to their melting temperatures.",contradiction
"Besides, the values of V/V 0 obtained from Eq. (9) for the two crystals agree with the experimental data better than that obtained from Eqs. (10) or (11); the other superiority of relation (9) to (10) is that it is applicable for alkali halides up to their melting temperatures.",contradiction
"However, there is a limitation in using Eq. (10) to determine volume thermal expansion for alkali halides at higher temperatures.",contradiction
"In the cases of NaCl and KCl, at temperatures higher than, respectively, 950 and 1000K, Eq. (10) would yield imaginary results of V/V 0, as pointed out by Kushwah and Shanker [4].",contradiction
"(2) Eq. (9) is derived based on the assumption that the two diffusional driving force models presented, respectively, by Sharma and Sharma [9] and Singh [10] are equivalent.",contradiction
"It is of interest to note that, in the derivation of (9), a fundamental relationship, i.e. Eq. (6), is obtained directly from the above assumption.",contradiction
"In terms of Eq. (6), the product of the coefficient of volume thermal expansion ? and the isothermal bulk modulus KT is inversely proportional to the volume, or equivalently the product ?KTV is constant.",contradiction
"This is significantly different from the assumption, i.e. the product of ?KT is a constant, that appeared frequently in the literature [6] and taken by Shanker et al. [3,4] for the thermal pressure P TH (see Eq. (12)) in Eq. (10) and Kushwah et al. [7] for getting Eq. (11).",contradiction
"However, there is definite evidence [16,17] that the product ?KT should vary with the change in volume.",contradiction
It has been observed [16] that the product ?KT decreases with increasing temperature for sodium chloride at temperatures above the Debye temperature (see Fig. 7 in Ref. [16]).,contradiction
"Very recently, Singh et al. [18] examined some approximations for the relation between the coefficient of volume thermal expansion ?, the isothermal bulk modulus KT , and the volume V.",contradiction
"They found that, as far as the two products ?KT and ?KTV are concerned, the product ?KT does not remain constant within the accuracy of experimental but decreases with temperature above the Debye temperature, and the product ?KTV changes evidently less with temperature than the product ?KT does, which is clearly in favor of the arguments presented in this paper.",contradiction
"In addition, the thermal pressure given by Eq. (12) with a constant ?KT would be overestimated at higher temperatures if the fact that the product ?KT decreases with temperature above the Debye temperature is considered.",contradiction
"Efforts to modify the linear relation for thermal pressure by taking into account the variation of the product ?KT with volume have also been made [19,20].",contradiction
"In view of these facts, we may conclude that the assumption that ?KT is constant is a main factor leading to a larger discrepancy between the experimental data and the calculated results obtained, respectively, from Eqs. (10) and (11) at higher temperature, as shown in Tables 2 and 3.",contradiction
"(3) Being a good approximation [11?13] for solids at high temperatures, relation (8) for the temperature dependence of isothermal bulk modulus is taken in the derivation of Eq. (9).",contradiction
"Furthermore, I would like to point out an interesting fact that, starting from relation (8), we may obtain Eq. (9) in another way, although Eq. (9) is obtained in the previous section based on the assumption that the two diffusional driving force models are equivalent.",contradiction
Illustration of this point would be helpful to have a better understanding of Eq. (9).,contradiction
"Hence, we describe the method below.",contradiction
"Differentiating Eq. (8) with respect to T at constant pressure (P=0) leads directly to the following relationship:(13)(dKTdT)P=-?0KT0?0.Comparing Eq. (13) with the definition of the isothermal Anderson?Gruneisen parameter given by(14)?=-1?KT(dKTdT)P,we get(15)?KT?=?0KT0?0.In Tallon's model [21], the Anderson?Gruneisen parameter ? is considered to be directly proportional to the volume ratio V/V 0.",contradiction
"When we use this relationship in Eq. (15), we get simply relation (6) again.",contradiction
"Then, following the same procedure after getting Eq. (6), as described in Section 2, relation (9) is obtained here.",contradiction
"Taking the above analyses into account, we may conclude that the physical quantities involved with relation (9) are in good self-consistency.",contradiction
"Superhard materials like diamond and cubic boron nitride exhibit excellent mechanical, chemical and physical properties.",contradiction
"However, it is well known that diamond, for example, cannot be used in cutting tools for steel, owing to its instability at high temperature.",contradiction
"For this reason and because of the need to substitute expensive diamond in many other applications, new hard materials are required.",contradiction
"By using an empirical formula which relates the bulk modulus of tetrahedrally coordinated systems to the length and ionicity of their bonds, it was predicted as early as in 1985 that a material made from carbon and nitrogen should exhibit a bulk modulus higher than that of diamond due to the short length and higher covalence of the C?N bond ?1, 2?.",contradiction
As a consequence carbon nitrides have been proposed as candidates for new superhard materials.,contradiction
"Unfortunately, the synthesis of C3N4 is still restricted to the production of small amounts of samples, which are not sufficient for a correct structural characterisation.",contradiction
This restriction is possibly due to the technological difficulties of producing materials with the large amount of nitrogen that is required to chemically interact with carbon ?3?.,contradiction
Experimentalists have observed carbon nitride materials in amorphous or disordered phases ?4?6? as well as crystalline phases dispersed in an amorphous matrix ?7?8?.,contradiction
"Theoretical investigations on the subject have been made to explain the stability and mechanical properties of some of the synthesised crystalline carbon nitrides, and to predict the properties of the new hypothetical forms ?9?17?.",contradiction
"Recently, first principles calculations, within the local density approximation (LDA) ?18?21?, on the cubic form of C3N4 have shown a bulk modulus exceeding that of diamond ?15?16, 22?.",contradiction
Our goal is to employ a fast and reasonably accurate computational scheme in order to describe the stability and hardness mainly of carbon nitride compounds.,contradiction
"For this purpose, we compare the output of the usually very accurate full potential approach with methods based on a spherical shape approximation of the crystal potential.",contradiction
In this review we have focused our attention on the simple C3N4 system and as a starting point we have checked the relative energy stabilities and hardness of five hypothetical C3N4 phases.,contradiction
"These are: graphite-like, ?, ?, cubic and pseudocubic.",contradiction
"Three different Density Functional Theory (DFT) based methods within the LDA ?18?21? have been tested: Augmented Spherical Wave (ASW) ?23, 24?, Linear Muffin-tin Orbitals (LMTO) ?25, 26? and Full-potential Linearised Augmented Plane-Wave (FP-LAPW) ?27?.",contradiction
"For the exchange and correlation effects the parameterisation scheme of Van Barth and Hedin ?28? and Janak ?29? was used in the ASW and LMTO method, while in the FP-LAPW the Perdew and Wang 92 ?30? functional was assumed.",contradiction
"Further, particular attention has been given to the understanding of the chemical bonding implied in different stacking orders (AAA, ABA and ABC) of the graphite-like C3N4 phase.",contradiction
"Moreover, the differences in the electronic properties and stability have been stressed for the hexagonal and orthorhombic graphitic forms.",contradiction
The recently proposed orthorhombic phase shows a drastic change in the bonding conjugation along the graphitic layers due to the possibility of connecting the adjacent C3N3 rings by the two-fold coordinated nitrogen atom.,contradiction
"Looking at the building-up of the carbon nitride compounds, one could firstly envisage replacing C by N within graphite.",contradiction
However this results in an unstable electronic structure configuration.,contradiction
"This is due to the additional electrons of the nitrogen atoms, which have to be accommodated in unfavourable electronic bands.",contradiction
But if compounds are designed to be isoelectronic to diamond and graphite the stability and the electronic structures are changed.,contradiction
For instance graphitic-C3N4 has 32 valence electrons per formula unit when the 2s states are included.,contradiction
"Distributing the electrons on eight sites gives four electrons on each site, which is isoelectronic with diamond and graphite.",contradiction
The eighth site is a vacancy and the lone pairs of three of the nitrogen atoms are pointing toward this hole.,contradiction
"From this graphitic-C3N4 should have a similar band structure at the Fermi level as graphite, and C3N4 in three-dimensional networks is expected to have band gaps similar to diamond.",contradiction
"Consequently a series of different combinations of C, B and N can be investigated for the search of new hard compounds, provided that the following simple condition is respected: pZV B+mZV C+lZV N=4nThe values p, m, l and n are integers and Z V(B), Z V(C) and Z V(N) are the electron counts of the atomic valence states (2s and 2p) for boron, carbon and nitrogen respectively.",contradiction
"Examples are represented by the systems C3N4, C11N4, BN and BC2N.",contradiction
The total energy of the C3N4 systems were evaluated within the LMTO and ASW methods using the tetrahedron scheme for the k-space integration.,contradiction
A uniform 12 ž 12 ž 12 unit cell meshing according to the Monkhorst?Pack ?31? scheme was sufficient to ensure the total energy convergence (?E < 10?8 Ry energy difference between the last two successive cycles) in all the considered C3N4 phases.,contradiction
For diamond and c-BN the same 12 ž 12 ž 12 meshing was used to ensure the desired convergence.,contradiction
In both methods the Atomic Sphere Approximation (ASA) is used assuming overlapping spheres centred on the atomic sites where the potential has a spherical symmetry.,contradiction
"This is unproblematic for closely packed structures but for loosely packed ones such as those of graphitic-type C3N4, overlap is kept to a minimum by introducing pseudo atoms with atomic number Z = 0 and no core states at appropriate sites within the crystal lattice; those will be referred to as empty spheres (ES) hereafter.",contradiction
Another prerequisite of the ASA is that the sum of all sphere volumes is made equal to the volume of the unit cell.,contradiction
The remaining interstitial space is then neglected.,contradiction
In the present calculations we paid particular attention to an optimal choice of the atomic radii as well as the number and position of empty spheres used to meet the ASA criteria with a minimisation of the overlap between the spheres.,contradiction
The full potential total energy calculations of the C3N4 phases were performed using the same plane wave cut-off (87 plane waves/atom) and k-point number (300 total k-points) as for the ??C3N4 structure which has the largest number of atoms per unit cell (28).,contradiction
"For carbon and nitrogen atomic types, the same muffin-tin radius (R MT = 1.33 A?) was used and maintained fixed for all the investigated C3N4 structures.",contradiction
"By using different basis set cut-offs we found that at the equilibrium volumes around 87 wave functions per atom were sufficient to predict the bulk modulus for the carbon nitride phases, without any significant change when increasing the number of basis functions used.",contradiction
"For the c-BN system the FP-LAPW calculation was performed in order to estimate the bulk modulus by using the same parameter as Park, Terakura and Hamada ?32?.",contradiction
"The geometries of the C3N4 phases were taken from the theoretical work of Teter et al. ?15?, in which the equilibrium structures were determined with a pseudopotential plane wave approach (PP) ?33?.",contradiction
The hexagonal beta phase (??C3N4) contains 14 atoms per unit cell (P3 space group) and consists of fourfold coordinated carbon and three fold coordinated nitrogen atoms (figure 1 ).,contradiction
"This phase is a network of three-, four- and six-fold rings of tetrahedra.",contradiction
The alpha phase (??C3N4) has hexagonal symmetry and contains 28 atoms per unit cell (P31c space group).,contradiction
"It can be viewed as a sequence of A and B layers in an ABAB stacking, in which A is the ??C3N4 unit cell and B the mirror image of A (figure 2 ).",contradiction
"In figure 2, a labelling of carbon and nitrogen atoms is used and it will be referred to in the spectroscopy section.",contradiction
"The cubic structure (cubic?C3N4) is based on the high-pressure willemite-II phase of Zn2SiO4, where C substitutes Zn and Si and N substitutes O.",contradiction
This phase contains 28 atoms per unit cell and belongs to the  I 43m space group.,contradiction
"The pseudocubic structure, usually called defect-zinc blende (bl?C3N4), exhibits P 42m symmetry and contains seven atoms per unit cell.",contradiction
The graphitic form of C3N4 (graphitic?C3N4) is represented by a planar structure with an ABA ?15? stacking mode.,contradiction
The hexagonal unit cell contains 14 atoms and the symmetry is P 6 m2.,contradiction
"Each C atom is three-fold coordinated, as is one of the four N atoms per cell.",contradiction
The other three N atoms are two-fold coordinated (resonant bonds).,contradiction
This phase has been taken as a reference for the graphite-based structure in making comparison between the relative stabilities of different carbon nitrides.,contradiction
"For the graphitic phase, four other forms are predicted in the earlier works.",contradiction
The first one (AAA stacking mode ?13?) has seven atoms per unit cell and the space group is P 6 m2.,contradiction
"The second phase (ABC stacking mode ?12?) which belongs to the R3m space group, shows seven atoms in the unit cell and consists of graphite-like sheets with ABC rhombohedral stacking order.",contradiction
"The other two phases were recently suggested by Alves et al. ?34, 35?.",contradiction
These authors have succeeded to prepare carbon nitride powders with C3N4 stoichiometry by use of high pressure synthesis methods.,contradiction
The proposed structure from their X-ray diffraction is represented by an orthorhombic unit cell (figure 3 ) instead of the hexagonal one (figure 4 ).,contradiction
For this new phase a different vacancy ordering inside the graphitic plane was found.,contradiction
Two new structures (P2mm space group) with respectively AAA (seven atoms per unit cell) and ABA (14 atoms per unit cell) stacking mode were proposed.,contradiction
For the cubic structures of boron nitride (c-BN) (F 43m) ?36? and diamond (Fd 3 m) ?37? calculations were performed on the experimental geometries.,contradiction
For the C3N4 systems the full potential method predicts the same energy trend found by Teter et al. ?15? in their pseudopotential plane-wave calculations (see figure 5 and table I ).,contradiction
"Whilst the graphitic form with ABA stacking sequence is the most stable one, the ? phase lies only marginally higher in energy by 0.036 eV.",contradiction
The energy of the ? phase is found to be 0.615 eV above that of the ? structure.,contradiction
Even though the calculated energy difference between graphite and the ? phase is of the same order of magnitude as that calculated by Teter et.,contradiction
al.,contradiction
"?15?, i.e. 0.041 eV, the energy difference between ? and ? is estimated to be 0.615 eV instead of 0.266 eV.",contradiction
"Finally, the cubic and pseudocubic structures (simple cubic and defect-zinc blende phases) are estimated to have the highest total energies.",contradiction
"The simple cubic phase lies at 1.414 eV above the ? phase, while the defect-zinc blende lies at 1.617 eV higher.",contradiction
"The energy difference found for beta-cubic is 1.414 eV instead of 1.015 eV, as calculated with the pseudopotential method.",contradiction
In the same way the beta-defect-zinc blende energy difference is estimated to be 1.617 eV instead of 1.178 eV.,contradiction
"The use of Liu and Wentzcovitch ?12? geometries for the ??C3N4 and bl?C3N4 phase gives slightly different values for the total energy, but they still confirm the PP energy trend.",contradiction
The beta phase now lies slightly higher in energy (+0.021 5 eV) and the pseudocubic one at a slightly lower energy (?0.038 eV) with respect to our previous calculation (geometries of Teter et al.).,contradiction
The LMTO and ASW methods on the contrary predict lower energies for cubic structures and a higher one for the graphite-like phase.,contradiction
The obtained energy trend follows exactly the atomic densities and clearly indicates how the ASA approximation is no longer acceptable for less compact structures (i.e. graphite-like phases).,contradiction
"As a matter of fact, the layered phase is the least dense (? = 2.334 3 gúcm?3) and it lies at high energy, while the cubic phase is the most dense (? = 3.886 0 gúcm?3) and consequently is predicted to have the lowest energy.",contradiction
"Hence, the relative stability trends observed with LMTO and ASW are not comparable with those deduced from FP-LAPW and PP.",contradiction
This is due to the difficulty of getting reliable results from the use of empty spheres in describing phases with very different atomic packing.,contradiction
"In fact, in the graphitic phase a large amount of empty space must be filled in the unit cell whereas the reverse behaviour is found in the cubic structures where the ASA worked best.",contradiction
"Even if we cannot make a strict comparison between the relative stabilities, it is important to note that all these DFT methods are in agreement in predicting equilibrium volumes, bulk moduli and their pressure derivatives for c-BN and for all the analysed C3N4 phases ?16?.",contradiction
The stabilisation features can be further assessed using chemical bonding criteria based on the crystal orbital overlap populations (COOP) ?45? which consist of the expectation values from operators of the non diagonal elements of the overlap population matrix: c* ni k Sijcnj k=c* ni k<?ki r??kj r>cnj k where Sij represents an element of the overlap matrix of the basis functions and cnj (k) are the expansion coefficients entering the wave function of the nth band.,contradiction
Partial COOP coefficients Cij (E) are then obtained by integrating the above expression over the Brillion zone : Cij E=Cji E=1/?BZ ?n ?BZ d3 k Re c*nikSijcnjk ?E-?nk (Dirac function delta serving as a counter of states) which is often loosely designated as the overlap-population-weighted-DOS.,contradiction
"The total COOP are then evaluated as the sum over all non-diagonal elements, i.e.: CE=?iji=?j Cji E We have implemented the COOP within the ASW method to enable for precise chemical bonding determinations from self-consistent calculations.",contradiction
"For a detailed description and for significant examples, the reader is referred to the following papers ?46?48?.",contradiction
The COOP are positive when they describe bonding states and negative when they describe anti-bonding states; non-bonding states should exhibit very low intensity?COOP.,contradiction
The total COOP for the three different graphitic-C3N4 forms are shown in figure 11 .,contradiction
In as far as in all three forms the interlayer distance ranges from 3.07 A? to 3.45 A? these COOP can be considered to be mainly describing the in-layer interactions between carbon and nitrogen.,contradiction
In the lower energy region of the valence band the three curves are mainly of bonding character but at energies closer to the Fermi level the anti-bonding states start to dominate.,contradiction
The anti-bonding counterparts of the conduction band are found centred at around 2 and 7 eV while a bonding behaviour appears at higher energy.,contradiction
From this picture a qualitative explanation of the relative stability implied in the layers of the three graphitic phases could be suggested by taking into account the intensity of the anti-bonding states (negative COOP) up to the top of the valence band VB.,contradiction
The fact that a large part of the VB is mainly of bonding character for all the different stacking modes makes the anti-bonding peak close to the top of it the main discrimination point in accounting for the different stabilities (see the arrow at ?1 eV in figure 11).,contradiction
"In the conduction band CB, this is somehow stressed (see the arrows between 0 and 10 eV, figure 11), even though stability cannot be inferred from empty states.",contradiction
"This trend is also confirmed by a plot of the integrated COOP (figure 12 ), which leads to comparable stabilities of the different phases although the indications in the CB point to the AAA system as being of lowest anti-bonding character.",contradiction
"If we turn now the argumentation towards the stability inferred from the intra-planar interactions, the stability of the AAA phase with respect to the ABA and ABC can be assigned to the shorter C?N2 bond lengths (see table III), which implies stronger bonding conditions inside the graphitic layers.",contradiction
"A remark on the bonding is relevant here: in all cases, the top of the VB comprises of overall anti-bonding electrons.",contradiction
"This is also observed by our calculations on a bl?C3N4 phase made in order to stress this feature (figure 13 ), which exhibits COOP with similar anti-bonding behaviour.",contradiction
This thus points to the role of the number of valence electrons.,contradiction
From this it can be suggested that the departure from the isoelectronic rule proposed in õ 2 can play a role in changing this anti-bonding character and hence the relative stability of a compound ?49?.,contradiction
This is being investigated.,contradiction
"It is worthwhile to point to the shortening of the C?N bonds and its apparent connection with the magnitude of the band gaps: from table III, the C?N2 bond within the ring is the shortest for the AAA-type stacking which happens to have the smallest gap (1.769 eV, 1.692 eV and 0.938 eV for ABC, ABA and AAA respectively).",contradiction
"Since the C?N2 distance of 1.281 7 A? is closer to the typical double C = N bond lengths (? 1.28 A?), an increased reinforcement of the covalence and hence a larger delocalisation of the charge density is expected within the hetero-ring of the AAA phase.",contradiction
"Lastly, it should be mentioned here that, from our computational scheme (i.e. relying on the LDA as well as on the ASA), we do not expect to provide a complete reproduction of the interplanar interactions that are believed to play an important role in the graphitic compounds ?50?.",contradiction
"In order to have a complete and detailed overview of the relative stability involved in the different stacking systems (AAA, ABA and ABC), the strongest bonding interactions found within the sheets of the AAA phase should be weighted with the interatomic potential (van der Waals) acting in between the different graphitic layers.",contradiction
"DOS plots (figures 8?10 ) show that the energy range from ?5 eV to E F is dominated by the N2 (2s, 2p) states.",contradiction
"The main contribution to the Fermi level is thus given in all the three phases by the aromatic nitrogen constituting the C3N3 rings, while the C dominates the lower part of the valence states (from ?10 to ?4 eV).",contradiction
At the top of the valence band the AAA phase shows a single broader peak (N2) with respect to the other phases owing to the shorter C?N2 bond length.,contradiction
"At around 3 eV (conduction band) all the three phases possess a peak for the N2 and C states which tends to become higher and narrower by going from the AAA, ABA to the ABC phase.",contradiction
This trend can be justified by looking again at the length of the C?N2 bonds inside the layers.,contradiction
As a matter of fact an increased electron delocalisation inside the C3N3 heterocycle is expected for shorter C?N connections.,contradiction
"The FP-LAPW and ultrasoft pseudopotential methods agree quite well with each other in predicting, for the new orthorhombic structure, a comparable stability to that shown by the hexagonal one.",contradiction
Table VI lists all the calculated total energies for the two structures.,contradiction
"Although the energy reference is not the same for the two methods (core states are not included in the PP method), the energy difference between the two forms show values of similar order of magnitude, in favour of the orthorhombic variety.",contradiction
The very small difference in stability let us confirm the possibility of looking at the orthorhombic phase as a reasonable model for describing the graphitic-C3N4.,contradiction
The relative stability can also be qualitatively discussed using the COOP.,contradiction
The total and integrated COOP for the hexagonal and orthorhombic phases are shown in figures 14 and 15 respectively.,contradiction
"The two phases nearly show the same trend; in the lower energy region of the valence band the two curves are mainly of bonding character, while at energies closer to the Fermi level (E F) the anti-bonding states of the p orbitals start to dominate.",contradiction
The anti-bonding counterparts are found in the conduction band centred at 2 and 7 eV while a bonding behaviour appears at higher energy.,contradiction
Due to the larger electron delocalisation present in the orthorhombic lattice the smearing out of the curve is somehow found with respect to COOP of the hexagonal system.,contradiction
The projection of the total COOP onto the corresponding contributions arising from the different atoms (figure 16 ) clearly shows that in the lower region of the VB the interaction N3?C1 determines the positive contribution to the COOP even if all the other carbon-nitrogen interactions are showing a bonding character.,contradiction
At energy close the EF the main bonding character is found for the interactions N3?C1 and N1?C2 while N2?C2 and C2?N3 show a negative COOP.,contradiction
The description of the bonding within the layer seems to favour the snake-like delocalisation in as far as the N3?C1 and the C2?N3 globally display a positive interaction throughout the valence region.,contradiction
This shows the difficulty of carrying out this analysis to the point of making it resemble the picture expected by a chemist in his view of the resonant bonds.,contradiction
"This restriction is mainly due to the fact that our COOP analysis does not use directional orbitals view since all contributions from px , py and pz are included.",contradiction
"As shown in figures 14 and 15, the orthorhombic phase is clearly predicted to be more stable than the hexagonal one.",contradiction
"Of course, there is no doubt that COOP analysis represents an important qualitative tool for predicting relative stability between phases but at the same time it is relevant to stress that accurate full potential calculations performed on the same systems have shown very close energy differences (table VI).",contradiction
"Hence, we conclude our investigation by saying that the orthorhombic phase should be slightly favoured over the hexagonal phase even though a detailed COOP analysis leads to a larger thermodynamic energy difference.",contradiction
The calculations were carried out in the same framework of the DFT as described above with the VASP plane wave pseudopotential package ?51?61?).,contradiction
The interactions between the ions and the electrons are described by using ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudopotential (US-PP) ?62?.,contradiction
The parameterisation scheme used for the LDA is the Ceperley-Alder exchange-correlation potential ?63?.,contradiction
"In the plane wave pseudopotential approach, the rapid variation of the potential near the nuclei is avoided by substituting the Hamiltonian near the atoms with a smoother pseudo-Hamiltonian, which reproduces the valence energy spectrum.",contradiction
The core states are removed with the rapid variations of the wavefunctions near the nucleus.,contradiction
"The PP allows a considerable reduction of the necessary number of plane waves per atom for transition metal and first row elements, thus force and full stress tensor can be easily calculated and used to relax atoms into their ground state.",contradiction
A complete ions and volume relaxation was performed for the orthorhombic phase by using the conjugate-gradient algorithm ?64? and an energy cut-off of 25.57 Ry for the plane wave basis set.,contradiction
The Methfessel-Paxton smearing scheme ?65? was used for geometry relaxation while the tetrahedron method with Blo?chl corrections ?66? was implied for the total energy calculations.,contradiction
All the energies were converged with a k-point sampling using a 10 ž 10 ž 10 Monkhorst?Pack grid ?31?.,contradiction
Total energy calculations and electron density maps were performed on the optimised structures by using the accurate FP-LAPW total energy calculations (WIEN97 package ?27?).,contradiction
"The number of plane waves per atom used was 172 and a total of 100 k-points were implied, with a 4 ž 4 ž 4 sampling.",contradiction
"For carbon and nitrogen atom type, the same muffin-tin radius (R MT = 1.33 A?) was used.",contradiction
A qualitative stabilisation feature was assessed using the chemical bonding criteria.,contradiction
"The COOP were evaluated for the two C3N4 systems by using the ASW method ?23, 24?.",contradiction
Calculations were performed by applying the tetrahedron method for the k-space integration and 217 irreducible k-points generated from a uniform 12 ž 12 ž 12 mesh according to the Monkhorst-Pack scheme.,contradiction
The energy convergence criterion of ?E ? 10?8 Ry is more precise than in FP-LAPW (?E ? 10?3 Ry) because of the faster method in use.,contradiction
The geometry of the orthorhombic phase was taken from the original work of Alves et al. ?34? and for the sake of simplicity the AAA stacking order was considered.,contradiction
This phase consists of seven atoms per unit cell and belongs to the P2mm space group.,contradiction
"The optimised geometry of the hexagonal phase (P 6 m2) was taken from the early works ?13, 15? and an AAA stacking of the layers was assumed.",contradiction
"In both unit cells, each C atom is three-fold coordinated, as is one of the four N atoms per cell, while the other three N atoms are two-fold coordinated.",contradiction
"As it can be seen from figures 3 and 4, a different vacancy ordering inside the graphitic planes is found for the orthorhombic system with respect to the hexagonal one.",contradiction
"Starting from the geometry given by ?34?, the orthorhombic structure was optimised by using the PP method.",contradiction
Table IV shows the structural parameters relative to the orthorhombic phase before and after the full geometry optimisation.,contradiction
The most important modification found in the relaxed structure is the changing of the geometry relative to the C3N3 heterocycle.,contradiction
These rings are now no more symmetric as they were before the structural relaxation.,contradiction
A shortening in the interlayer distance from 3.20 A? to 3.12 A? is also found in the optimised geometry.,contradiction
A brief summary of the most important geometry changing in the orthorhombic phase is shown in table V .,contradiction
The atomic labelling schemes are given in figures 3 and 4.,contradiction
It is important to note that the optimisation of the hexagonal phase under the same conditions still leads to a symmetric geometry of the C3N3 rings.,contradiction
The DOS plot calculated with the ASW method (figure 17 ) for the orthorhombic phase clearly shows that a more semi-metallic behaviour is present in this new graphitic-C3N4 form.,contradiction
The electronic levels are now crossing the Fermi energy and a more significant contribution of the electronic states from the N1 atom is found at the E F (compare with N1 peak in figure 8).,contradiction
"In contrast to the band gap of 0.938 eV calculated for the hexagonal form, a semi-metallic-like behaviour is thus found in the orthorhombic phase.",contradiction
Moreover the nitrogen DOS in the orthorhombic structure is broadened with respect to the DOS of the hexagonal one (figure 8).,contradiction
This behaviour can be addressed to the strong role played by the N1 atom in mediating in between neighbouring heterocycle rings.,contradiction
With the help of the FP-LAPW method the change in the electronic properties can be also visualised by looking at the electron density maps.,contradiction
The orthorhombic system shows a clear charge density delocalisation coming along the direction of the b-axis with a sort of a snake-like shape (figure 18 ).,contradiction
"The total density of states plot (FP-LAPW method) relative to the orthorhombic phase (figure 19 ) shows an increasing metallic behaviour, where the electronic levels of nitrogen and carbon are crossing the E F as already stressed for the ASW method.",contradiction
For the hexagonal system the calculated electronic density map shows a confined electronic circulation inside the C3N3 rings ?17?.,contradiction
A band gap of 1.48 eV is found in the total DOS analysis (figure 20 ).,contradiction
The two methods of calculation confirm the previous hypothesis of Alves et al. about a drastic modification on the electronic structure.,contradiction
An accurate way to carry out an experimental determination of the bonding environment is to use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) involving deep core electrons excitations.,contradiction
"For carbon nitride layered compounds, the C(1s) binding energies are scattered over a rather wide region, ranging from 284.5 to 290.0 eV.",contradiction
This is due to the many bonding possibilities for carbon.,contradiction
"All types of hybridisations are assumed to be present such as sp2, and sp3, and the carbon atoms can be bonded to a different number of nitrogen atoms.",contradiction
Systematic investigations were carried out for the C(1s) core energy shift in such compounds containing different amounts of nitrogen ?67?.,contradiction
The given assignments indicate a 0.5?1 eV shift to higher values when one N is attached to the C atom.,contradiction
An additional increase of almost 1 eV is expected when carbon is connected to two nitrogen atoms.,contradiction
It was of course difficult to conclude to whether the C atoms were sp2 or sp3 hybridised.,contradiction
"For this purpose computational results can be helpful, provided accurate all electron methods be used such as the FP-LAPW.",contradiction
In order to calculate total energies comparable with experimental XPS values a core-excitation procedure was used.,contradiction
The 1s2 core-state occupation number of the excited atom was set to 1.,contradiction
The extra electron was placed in the valence band and a self-consistent energy was obtained.,contradiction
Although this procedure keeps the compound neutral the unit cell had to be increased for diamond and graphite in order to minimise core-hole interaction between adjacent cells.,contradiction
For the other compounds investigated with this approach the unit cells are larger and they were not increased.,contradiction
The same number of k-points and cut-off parameters were used as for the full symmetry unit cell calculations.,contradiction
A local p function was added at 1.5 Ry to improve the description of the excited states.,contradiction
"The final energies, to be compared with the experimental XPS values, were obtained by taking the difference between the total energies of the ground state and the excited state, and from this value the difference in Fermi levels between the two states was subtracted.",contradiction
These final energies are denoted as the Fermi level corrected values.,contradiction
It should be noted that introducing a core-hole breaks the symmetry of the unit cell.,contradiction
This makes this kind of calculations computationally demanding.,contradiction
The geometries of the C3N4 compounds were taken from the theoretical work of Teter ?15? and relaxed as mentioned in former sections.,contradiction
For diamond and graphite experimental geometries were used.,contradiction
The out of plane lattice parameter was put to 3.40 A? and the AAA stacking mode was used.,contradiction
The difference in energy between the graphite and the graphitic?C3N4 like unit cells was negligible.,contradiction
"Using three different first-principles techniques, we have examined a series of hypothetical C3N4 phases to determine their stability and hardness.",contradiction
With the use of FP-LAPW method we predict a relative energy trend in agreement with the early PP calculations.,contradiction
"The graphitic- and ?-C3N4 phases are predicted to have the lowest total energy with high compressibility, while the two C3N4 cubic phases are energetically less stable but with higher bulk moduli.",contradiction
"On the contrary, the ASA based LMTO and ASW methods cannot reproduce a reasonable energy trend due to the difficulty of describing phases with different atomic densities.",contradiction
The ASA approximation fits quite well for the cubic structures but it does not for less compact systems like the graphitic one.,contradiction
"Even though we cannot compare the relative stabilities, LMTO and ASW techniques reproduce the lattice constants and the bulk moduli in good agreement with the FP-LAPW and PP methods.",contradiction
As a matter of fact all the three methods predict the highest Bo for cubic-C3N4 phase and the lowest for ?-C3N4 phase.,contradiction
This demonstrates that all these DFT methods are suitable for the hardness simulation of carbon nitrides.,contradiction
"To describe the role of the chemical bonding within the crystal lattice of the graphitic-C3N4 phases (AAA, ABA and ABC), an analysis of the DOS and the COOP was carried out.",contradiction
The DOS analysis for all the three phases shows that at the top of the valence band the N2 atoms have the highest intensity.,contradiction
"Because in the same region and in a large part of the conduction band the COOP plots show different anti-bonding magnitudes, we can now qualitatively estimate the relative stabilities by looking at the C?N2 anti-bonding character.",contradiction
The hexagonal AAA phase is then predicted to have a slightly lower anti-bonding intensity and hence a higher stability of the layers with respect to the other stacking modes.,contradiction
"Further, the optimisation of the orthorhombic phase with the US-PP method leads to an asymmetric equilibrium structure for the C3N3 ring inside the graphitic-C3N4 layer.",contradiction
A shortening of the carbon-nitrogen bond is found along the snake-like path owing to the ?-delocalisation present along the b-axis.,contradiction
The electron density map calculated with the FP-LAPW method also confirms the possibility for the orthorhombic phase to extend the electron delocalisation between the adjacent C3N3 rings.,contradiction
"This behaviour is mainly due to the changing of the coordination number for the N1 atom, which goes from three in the hexagonal lattice to two in the orthorhombic one.",contradiction
A DOS analysis performed with the FP-LAPW and ASW methods have shown an increased semi-metallic behaviour for the orthorhombic system: the electronic states are crossing the E F and the band gap disappears.,contradiction
"Moreover, the FP-LAPW and US-PP methods agree quite well with each other in predicting a small energy difference between the hexagonal and orthorhombic phase.",contradiction
Both lattice systems seem to be a reasonable proposal for the graphitic?C3N4 model even though a clear changing in the electronic properties was found for the orthorhombic phase.,contradiction
"Despite the success of the systematics of the isoelectronic count with diamond that we followed in our choice of carbon nitrides as candidates for ultra-hard materials, it would be relevant to consider a departure from this rule.",contradiction
"Further, bent and eventually closing structures are being considered.",contradiction
The energy shifts in table VII and the Fermi level corrected values in table VIII together with a 2 eV correction suggest the XPS energies in table IX that allows us to present a conclusion for the spectroscopic part.,contradiction
From the C 1s values it is clear that tetrahedral carbon in C3N4 phases should be distinguishable by having rather high energies.,contradiction
The N 1s values of ? and bl?C3N4 may serve as a measure of XPS energies of pyramidal nitrogen atoms in C sp3 environments with low nitrogen concentration.,contradiction
The reason is that in these systems the distance between N atoms in the direction of the nitrogen lone pair is rather long.,contradiction
"The values of ??C3N4 show that this phase should be detected by C 1s energies above 289.5 eV and two N 1s peaks at approximately 400.0 and 400.6 eV, that correlate in intensity with the high C peak.",contradiction
However no such correlation could be obtained in the experimental work referred to here.,contradiction
Despite large amount of results of this work we still need to meet furthermore the experimental findings as to the low concentrations of nitrogen found in the carbon nitride layers.,contradiction
These observations have led to the proposal of a graphitic?C11N4 compound.,contradiction
Its thorough study within the same framework as that for the C3N4 compounds is underway.,contradiction
Several early attempts have been published (e.g. see Refs. [1?5]) aiming at determining the physical properties of alkali halides mixed crystals in terms of the properties of their end members.,contradiction
These have been summarized in two independent reviews by Sirdeshmukh and Srinivas [6] and by Varotsos and Alexopoulos [7].,contradiction
"Later, it became clear that these materials can find a variety of potential applications in optical, optoelectronic and electronic devices.",contradiction
"These include the development of alkali halide polycrystalline materials for use as optical laser windows [8,9] as well as applications dealing with good dielectric substrate for the electron carriers conducting paths in microcircuits, useful in avoiding short circuits [10?12].",contradiction
"The latter microcircuits have a tendency to reach the nanoscale dimensions, thus making further studies on the subject a necessity.",contradiction
"Among these recent experimental studies [13?23], here we restrict ourselves to ones published by Padma and Mahadevan [20,23], in which they reported that multiphased mixed crystals were grown by the melt method, for the first time, using N?Br and KCl as the starting materials.",contradiction
Five mixed systems were finally formed [20]: MC1: (N?Cl)0.165(KBr)0.275(KCl)0.560; MC2: (N?Cl)0.254(KBr)0.573(KCl)0.173; MC3: (N?Cl)0.587(KBr)0.413; MC4: (N?Cl)0.249(KBr)0.526(N?Br)0.225 and MC5: (N?Cl)0.082(KBr)0.300(N?Br)0.618.,contradiction
These are written in Table 1 by following a sequence of decreasing concentration in their constituents.,contradiction
"Padma and Mahadevan [23] determined a series of thermal parameters like Debye?Waller factor, Debye temperature, Debye frequency and mean square amplitude of vibration, using the X-ray powder diffraction intensity data.",contradiction
In addition they made DC and AC electrical measurements by using the parallel plate capacitor method at various temperatures.,contradiction
"The latter measurements of conductivity ? were fitted into the usual [24] equation ?=? 0 exp(?E/kT) and the relevant activation energy E was determined (here, k stands for Boltzmann's constant, ? 0 a constant depending on the material and T the absolute temperature).",contradiction
"The relevant values for the density ?, the energy E and the compressibility ? of the above five mixed systems, as measured by Padma and Mahadevan [20,23], are inserted in Table 1.",contradiction
"The density ? is taken from Ref. [20], while the quantities ? and E from Ref. [23].",contradiction
An inspection of Table 1 shows that the corresponding values measured for the five mixed crystals differ markedly.,contradiction
"For example, when restricting ourselves to the conductivity values of mixed crystals, they are found to be more for the binary mixed crystal MC3: (N?Cl)0.587(KBr)0.413 than those for the others.",contradiction
"MC1 and MC2 contain KCl in addition to N?Cl and KBr, whereas MC4 and MC5 contain N?Br in addition to N?Cl and KBr.",contradiction
"It was found [23] that in the case of ternary mixed crystals, the presence of N?Br leads to larger conductivity values.",contradiction
"A point of crucial importance that emerges upon studying the values of the quantities E, ? and ? of the aforementioned mixed systems, is whether an interrelation exists among them.",contradiction
"In the present paper, we shall show that such an interconnection does exists if we take advantage of an early model that has been suggested for the interrelation between the defect parameters and bulk qualities, as it will be summarized below.",contradiction
"It has long been suggested [25?32] that the defect Gibbs energy g i , where the superscript i refers to the defect process under consideration, e.g. defect formation, defect migration, self-diffusion activation, is given by(1)gi=ciB?where B stands for the bulk modulus (=1/?), ? the mean volume per atom and c i is a dimensionless constant independent of temperature and pressure.",contradiction
This model is usually termed cB? model.,contradiction
"Upon differentiating Eq. (1) with respect to pressure P, and considering that the defect volume is given by ? i=(dg i/dP)T, we find(2)?i=ci?(dB/dp|T-1) The Gibbs energy g i is connected to the activation enthalpy h i and activation entropy s i through the relation g i=h i?Ts i , which in the low-temperature range (Ts i?h i) becomes g i?h i.",contradiction
"Thus, Eq. (1) can be approximately written as(3)hi?ciB? The capability of Eq. (1) to describe the experimental data has been checked for different defect processes in a variety of solids including sodium and potassium halides [27], fluorides [32?34] and diamond [34].",contradiction
It also enables the explanation that the enthalpy h i scales with the melting temperature [35] and in addition allows the description of complex cases like the indenter penetration into a (ionic) crystal surface [36] (during which electric signals are emitted in a similar fashion as the electric signals measured before earthquakes [37?39]).,contradiction
"Finally, recent investigations [40] revealed that the cB? model was found of value to qualitatively explain the non-Arrhenius behavior in the temperature dependence of the viscosity of glass-forming liquids.",contradiction
"Motivated by the success of Eq. (1) to describe a large variety of data in various categories of solids, we now attempt its applicability to the mixed systems measured in Ref. [23].",contradiction
Along these lines we now indicate the procedure to estimate a quantity similar to ?.,contradiction
"We consider a mixed system AxBy ? xC1? y where the three end members A, B, C will be equivalently labeled as the pure components (1), (2) and (3), respectively, with volumes ? 1, ? 2 and ? 3 per ?molecule? and hence have molar volumes, V 1=N? 1, V 2=N? 2 and V 3=N? 3, where N stands for Avogadro's number.",contradiction
"Without loss of generality, let us now assume that the pure component (1) is the major component in the system AxBy ? xC1? y and further assume that ? 1 is smaller than the volumes ? 2 and ? 3 per ?molecule? of the pure components (2) and (3), respectively.",contradiction
"The volume VN+n2+n3 of a crystal containing N molecules of type (1), n 2 molecules of type (2) and n 3 molecules of type (3) is given by(4)VN+n2+n3=m1+(n2/N)m2+(n3/N)m3?Nwhere m 1, m 2 and m 3 are the masses of the ?molecules? of the three pure components and ? is the density of the mixed system.",contradiction
"Note that [7] (5)n2N=y-xxandn3N=1-yx Hence VN+n2+n3, can be determined from Eq. (4) upon considering Eq. (5) and therefore ? is estimated through ?=VN+n2+n3/N.",contradiction
"In addition, the measurements of Ref. [23] provide the compressibility ? of the mixed crystal from which we determine the corresponding bulk modulus B=1/?.",contradiction
"Thus, we are able to investigate the validity of Eq. (1) or Eq. (3).",contradiction
"Following the procedure explained in the previous section, we calculate the quantity B? for each of the five mixed systems measured in Refs. [20,23].",contradiction
"Then we plot in Fig. 1 the activation energy E, as measured in Ref. [23], versus B?.",contradiction
An inspection of this figure reveals that four (out of five) systems do show that the energy E varies linearly with B? in accordance to Eq. (3) (recall that E coincides with h i for isobaric measurements).,contradiction
"This, which provides the main finding of the present paper, suggests that the quantities E, ? and ? measured in the mixed systems by Padma and Mahadevan [20,23] seem to be interconnected.",contradiction
We now discuss the reason why the constant c i involved in Eq. (1) or Eq. (3) (see also below) seems to be approximately the same in the four mixed systems that obey the linear relationship evident in Fig. 1.,contradiction
This could be understood as follows: Eq. (2) can be alternatively written as(6)ci=(?i/?)/(dB/dP|T-1) Note that Eq. (6) still holds irrespective if the right-hand side of Eq. (1)?and hence that of Eq. (3)?has an additional constant ? which does not vary with pressure (see Chapter 14 of Ref. [7]).,contradiction
"This is so, because when differentiating the relation g i=c i B?+? with respect to pressure?and then recalling that ? i=(dg i/dP)T?we find that Eq. (2) (and therefrom Eq. (6)) is still valid.",contradiction
"We now consider that the dB/dP values of various sodium and potassium halides vary only slightly [41,42] and hence it is expected to be so far their mixed systems as well.",contradiction
"The same holds for the ratios ? i/? if one takes into account the early measurements of Lazarus et al. [43,44].",contradiction
"Thus, it seems reasonable that the c i values of four (out of five) mixed systems are comparable.",contradiction
"Unfortunately, we have not yet achieved any explanation for the strong deviation of the system MC1 from the aforementioned linearity.",contradiction
"We finally discuss the point that the present findings are strikingly reminiscent of the following case: the cB? model was found [45] to describe the formation volume of Schottky defects in a certain class of high-T c superconductors and in addition plays a decisive role towards understanding the trend of melting temperatures for the RB?2Cu3O7? ? (R-123, R=yttrium and lanthanides) cuprate high-T c superconductors [46].",contradiction
"In particular, in type-II superconductors, high current densities can be achieved by the presence of high-density defects which provide suitable pinning centers for the magnetic flux lines.",contradiction
"In such a case, point defects play an important role in cuprates such as YB?2Cu3O7? ? (Y-123).",contradiction
"Upon doping them with alkaline earth elements, bulk and grain-boundary transports are greatly improved.",contradiction
"It was found [45] that in the latter superconductors, the formation volume of Schottky defects obeys the behavior predicted by the cB? model.",contradiction
"On the other hand, the model does not seem to describe the case when the replacement of Y is made by rare-earth elements.",contradiction
"This strikingly reminds the behavior observed in Fig. 1, where most of the points indicate that E varies linearly with B?, while the mixed system MC1 does not.",contradiction
"Here we showed that the activation energy that governs the temperature dependence of the conductivity in four out of five multiphased binary and ternary mixed crystals varies linearly with B? using experimental data alone, i.e. the inverse of the compressibility measured in Ref. [23] and the density values determined in Ref. [20].",contradiction
"This behavior, which is similar to the one recently reported in a certain class of high-T c superconductors, was inspired from the so-called cB? model that interconnects point defects parameters with bulk elastic and expansivity data.",contradiction
"RuSi has long been known to form in two modifications, i.e. CsCl-type at high temperatures, and FeSi-type at low temperatures.",contradiction
"The transition temperature has recently been determined as 1300øC for stoichiometric material, but is strongly dependent on the exact stoichiometry.",contradiction
We have evaluated the structures of both phases under applied pressure of up to 40 GPa.,contradiction
No evidence for a pressure-induced transition was found.,contradiction
"The bulk moduli of CsCl- and FeSi-type RuSi were determined as (215 ñ 15) GPa and (255 ñ 15) GPa, respectively.",entailment
Transport and optical properties of both modifications have been investigated.,contradiction
"Obviously, the CsCl-modification is metallic, whilst the FeSi-modification is a narrow-gap semiconductor with a gap of 0.2=0.3 eV.",contradiction
"Molecular dynamics calculations of bulk properties of solid C60 and C70, simulated in terms of a simple two-body potential, are presented.",contradiction
The bulk moduli and the room temperature equations of state are determined and compared with the available experimental data.,contradiction
The change in the lattice parameters as a function of pressure and temperature is also investigated.,contradiction
The development of nanocrystalline alloys has been attracting much attention for the past several years.,contradiction
"Many techniques were developed to produce nanocrystalline alloys: mechanical alloying [1], reactive milling [2], chemical reduction [3]and evaporation [4, 5]etc.",contradiction
The ultra-fine metallic particles produced were usually consolidified in a following procedure to form bulk samples.,contradiction
It was also found that crystallization of some kinds of amorphous alloys could evolve nanocrystalline microstructures [6?9].,contradiction
"Up to now, much work was done on the two kinds of amorphous alloys: Fe?Si?B?Nb?Cu alloy [8, 10?12]and the Al-based alloys, e.g. Al?Y?Fe alloy [13]and Al?Y?Ni alloy [9, 14, 15].",contradiction
These amorphous alloys can evolve into microstructures of nanocrystals of the size of 10?20 nm embedded in an amorphous matrix.,contradiction
The former nanocrystalline alloy shows excellent magnetic properties and the latter show good mechanical properties.,contradiction
"These amorphous alloys were prepared by rapid quenching, therefore, their properties were measured in the ribbon form [14].",contradiction
"The strength was usually measured by uniaxial tension of the melt-spun ribbons and the brittleness was usually evaluated by a bending test [14, 16].",contradiction
"More recently, some bulk amorphous alloys were also found to evolve into nanocrystalline microstructures during annealing, e.g. the Zr?Be?Ti?Cu?Ni alloy and the Zr?Ti?Al?Cu?Ni alloy [17?19].",contradiction
These alloys make it possible to study the evolution of the nanocrystalline microstructures more comprehensively and to measure the mechanical properties of the nanocrystallized alloys with bulk samples.,contradiction
"Mechanical test with bulk samples may yield more information than with ribbons, e.g.: (1) The deformation instability of ribbons can be eliminated; (2) The serrated deformation behavior, which is a characteristic deformation behavior of amorphous phase, can be more pronounced by using compression test; and (3) Studies may be made on the variation of the fracture surface to the load axis due to the increase of the crystalline fractions and the variation of the fracture morphology thereof.",contradiction
Amorphous alloys usually have high strength and excellent ductility.,contradiction
"However, some amorphous alloys become very brittle after partial crystallization (or even structural relaxation), e.g. the classic Fe?B?Si based amorphous alloys [16, 20?22], whereas some amorphous alloys remain ductile in the partially crystallized state, e.g. the Al?Y?Ni amorphous alloy [14].",contradiction
"Although the mechanism of embrittlement is not comprehensively clear [16], the properties of the annealed amorphous alloys are closely related to the crystallization behaviors of the amorphous alloys and the evolved microstructures.",contradiction
The high ductility of the partially crystallized Al?Y?Ni amorphous alloy was attributed to the unique microstructures of nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous matrix [14].,contradiction
"This paper studies the crystallization behavior of the Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 bulk amorphous alloy, the evolution mechanism of the nanocrystalline microstructures, the deformation behavior and mechanical properties of the amorphous and partially nanocrystallized alloy with different crystalline fractions.",contradiction
"Initial ingots of the Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 alloy, with mass ranging from 30 to 47 g, were prepared by melting appropriate amounts of Zr, Ti, Al, Cu and Ni with electromagnetic induction in a water-cooled copper crucible under He atmosphere.",contradiction
These ingots were then remelted by electromagnetic levitation under He atmosphere and allowed to drop into copper molds to form amorphous samples.,contradiction
The as-cast amorphous samples used for the mechanical test are of a cylindrical shape with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of 50 mm.,contradiction
The amorphous state of the cast samples was checked by X-ray diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).,contradiction
"The crystallization behaviors of the amorphous alloy and the evolution of the microstructures were studied with DSC, X-ray diffractometry and a Topcon 002B high resolution electron transmission microscope (HRTEM) operating at 200 kV.",contradiction
The crystallization enthalpy was measured by integrating the exothermic peaks of the DSC curves separately.,contradiction
"To a first approximation, the volumetric crystallization fractions of the annealed specimens were calculated by the ratio of the heat release during annealing to the total crystallization enthalpy of the fully amorphous alloy.",contradiction
"Although the crystallization fractions are usually calculated by this method [23, 24], it is necessary to note that the heat release for the formation of per volumetric fraction of crystalline phases may be different in every crystallization step because the crystallization enthalpy for every phase may be different.",contradiction
The mechanical tests were performed by compression at room temperature.,contradiction
The strain rate was 2.8ž10?4 s?1.,contradiction
The test specimens were machined into cylinders of 3 mm diameter by 6 mm length.,contradiction
"The annealing of the specimens for the compression test was performed at a temperature between 653 and 673 K for various times, resulting in crystalline fractions between 10 and 70% (the crystalline fraction was checked by DSC after each annealing).",contradiction
Hardness was measured by a Vickers microhardness tester under a load of 1.94 N (200 gf).,contradiction
Fig. 8 shows the compressive stress?strain curves of the Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 amorphous alloy in the as-cast state (a) and after partial crystallization (b) and (c).,contradiction
"The deformation behavior of the as-cast amorphous alloy is characteristic of large elastic deformation, slight work hardening and distinct serrated flow during plastic deformation.",contradiction
The serrated flow is composed of short curve sections which are roughly parallel to the curve in the elastic deformation part.,contradiction
The serrated curve sections are separated by abrupt failures.,contradiction
No smooth plastic flow appears in the whole plastic deformation region.,contradiction
"This serrated deformation can be associated with the propagation of narrow shear bands [28, 29].",contradiction
"The as-cast amorphous alloy shows a moderate Young's modulus of 65 GPa, a high yielding stress of 1560 MPa and a fracture stress of 1650 MPa.",contradiction
"When combined with densities of 6.6 g cm?3, the specific strength reaches the very high value of 240 kPa m3 kg?1.",contradiction
Fig. 8(b) and (c) show the compressive stress?strain curves of the partially crystallized alloys.,contradiction
"The partially crystallized alloys have higher yielding stress and fracture stress than the as-cast amorphous alloy, with the highest values of about 1800 and 1950 MPa, respectively.",contradiction
The Young's modulus increases up to about 75 GPa (Fig. 8(c)).,contradiction
"When the crystalline fraction is below about 45%, the value of elastic deformation shows no distinct change.",contradiction
"The amount of plastic deformation decreases with the crystalline fraction, especially when the crystalline fraction is about 40%.",contradiction
The serrated deformation behavior remains (Fig. 8(b)) indicating that the partially crystallized alloys with crystalline fraction <40% still deforms in a manner typical of amorphous alloys.,contradiction
"When the crystalline fraction is >45%, the fracture stress and the elastic deformation begin to decrease.",contradiction
"When the crystalline fraction is less than ?40%, the compressed specimen breaks usually with a fracture surface inclined by ?45ø to the load axis.",contradiction
"When the crystalline fraction is above ?40%, the specimens break usually with an uneven fracture surface inclined randomly to the load axis.",contradiction
The fracture surface of the as-cast amorphous alloy shows typical vein patterns (Fig. 9 (a)).,contradiction
"When the crystalline fractions are less than ?40%, the fracture surfaces of the partially crystallized alloys also show vein patterns, but the diameters of the vein patterns decrease with the crystalline fraction, as shown in Fig. 9(b) and (c).",contradiction
"Around the crystalline fractions between ?40 and 45%, the fracture surfaces seem to change from the ductile nature to the brittle nature.",contradiction
The fracture surface usually have different kinds of morphologies.,contradiction
"Some parts of the uneven fracture surface, which usually incline to the load axis by about 40?50ø, display vein patterns, as shown by Fig. 9(c).",contradiction
"Some parts have a morphology of very fine patterns and some parts have a morphology of brittle fracture, as shown in Fig. 9(d).",contradiction
"For the alloys with more crystalline fractions, e.g. 68%, the fracture surface is totally of brittle fracture nature, as show in Fig. 9(e).",contradiction
"In amorphous alloys, the vein patterns originate from the deformation of narrow shear bands.",contradiction
It was proposed that the behavior of the shear band was similar to a thin viscous layer between two parallel plates under tension.,contradiction
"Shallow cavities nucleate and the bridges between them break, leaving the veins [30, 31].",contradiction
"For the decrease of the viscosity along the surface of the catastrophic shear, one hypothesis was attributed to the local temperature increase in the catastrophic shear band because of adiabatic heating due to the work of the plastic shear [32, 33].",contradiction
Another hypothesis refers the viscosity decrease to the intensive increase of the `free volume' in the shear band owing to a high hydrostatic tension [34].,contradiction
"In the present experiments, a flash of light was observed when the final rapture occurred.",contradiction
This may be an indication that the catastrophic shear surface has a high temperature during rapture.,contradiction
"In some parts of the fracture surfaces, the vein patterns seem to have the trace of `viscous layer', as shown in Fig. 10 .",contradiction
These results are consistent with the view that temperature rise causes the decrease of the viscosity in the shear bands that cause failure.,contradiction
"When the nanocrystals are separated by the amorphous matrix and the crystals are much smaller than the shear bands, the deformation of the shear bands is dominated by the amorphous matrix, but the nanocrystals act as barriers to the deformation of the shear bands, as a result, the fracture surface still shows vein pattern but the diameter of the veins is reduced (Fig. 9(a), (b) and (c)).",contradiction
"When the nanocrystals occupy large volumetric fractions or the crystals are connected, the deformation behavior is not dominated by the amorphous phase and consequently shows brittle feature (Fig. 6 and Fig. 9(e)).",contradiction
The crystalline fraction of ?40?45% seems to be the critical point for the change in the deformation nature.,contradiction
Fig. 11 shows the variation of the yield stress as a function of the crystalline fraction.,contradiction
The yield stress increases with the crystalline fraction to ?45%.,contradiction
"With further more crystalline fraction, the alloys shows only the elastic deformation region, no yield points appear before the final fracture (Fig. 8).",contradiction
The variation of the yielding stress is consistent with the changes of the fracture morphology (Fig. 9).,contradiction
"When the deformation is dominated by the amorphous matrix, yielding point and serrated plastic deformation regions appear (Fig. 8).",contradiction
"The precipitated nanocrystals act as barriers to the propagation of the shear bands, leading to the increase of the yielding stress.",contradiction
"When the deformation changes to the brittle nature, no plastic deformation region and yielding point appear.",contradiction
Fig. 12 shows the variation of the fracture stress as a function of the volumetric crystalline fraction.,contradiction
The fracture stress increases with the crystalline fraction to ?45% and then decreases with the further increase of the crystalline fraction.,contradiction
This curve indicates that a proper composite microstructure of nanocrystals in an amorphous matrix can lead to an optimum mechanical property.,contradiction
"The microstructure with nanocrystalline matrix may lead, not only to brittleness, but also decrease of the strength.",contradiction
"When the amorphous matrix is kept, a small amount of precipitated nanocrystals leads to the increase of the fracture stress and yielding stress, but causes a slight decrease of the ductility, i.e. little decrease of the total deformation value and the serrated plastic deformation values (Fig. 8).",contradiction
"When the crystalline fraction reaches a critical value, e.g. ?40?45%, the fracture stress reaches the highest value.",contradiction
"Although the serrated plastic deformation region is nearly eliminated at this critical value of crystalline fraction, the elastic deformation value has no significant variation (Fig. 8).",contradiction
"As shown in Fig. 9, this critical value corresponds to the transition of the fracture mechanism.",contradiction
"As shown in Fig. 3, a crystalline fraction >40% corresponds to the crystallization associated with the second crystallization stage (peak).",contradiction
"After this stage of crystallization, the nanocrystals connect and the amorphous phase loses its matrix nature (Fig. 6).",contradiction
Fig. 13 shows the variation of Young's modulus as a function of the crystalline fraction.,contradiction
"Structural relaxation increases the values of the Young's modulus, e.g. annealing at 573 K for 40 min increases the value from about 65 GPa to about 70 GPa.",contradiction
The Young's modulus increases with the crystalline fractions to ?45% and then decreases with increasing crystalline fractions.,contradiction
It is known that the Young's modulus is closely related to the free volume of the amorphous alloys and the bond nature between the atoms [28].,contradiction
The increase of the Young's modulus with the structural relaxation can be related to the decrease of the free volume.,contradiction
"For the partially crystallized alloys, the precipitated crystals and the residual amorphous phase (due to the composition changes) may have different Young's modulus from the original amorphous phase, causing the variation of the Young's moduli with the crystalline fraction.",contradiction
"However, one may notice the fact that the variation of the Young's moduli (Fig. 13) is consistent with variation of the yield stress (Fig. 11) and the fracture stress (Fig. 12) which are closely associated with the microstructures of the partially crystallized alloys.",contradiction
"Moreover, the structurally relaxed amorphous alloy has nearly the same Young's modulus values as the partially crystallized alloy with about 74% crystals (Fig. 13), indicating that the precipitated crystalline phases may not have significantly higher Young's modulus than the structurally relaxed amorphous phase.",contradiction
"Therefore, it may be proposed that the microstructures of nanocrystals embedded in the amorphous matrix are a contribution to the increase of the Young's modulus which reaches the highest value when the alloy has an optimum microstructure, e.g. ?45% nanocrystals embedded in the amorphous matrix.",contradiction
Fig. 14 shows the variation the hardness as a function of the crystalline fraction.,contradiction
The hardness increases linearly with the crystalline fraction.,contradiction
The as-cast amorphous alloy has a hardness of about 520 (HV) and the fully crystallized alloy has a hardness of about 700 (HV).,contradiction
Fig. 1 shows the DSC curves of the Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 amorphous alloy.,contradiction
"At a heating rate of 0.33 K s?1, the amorphous alloy shows a glass transition temperature, T g, of about 650 K, an onset crystallization temperature, T x, of about 705 K and a supercooled liquid interval, ?T x(=?T x?T g), of 55 K.",contradiction
There are three exothermic peaks.,contradiction
The first two peaks show no significant variation with the cooling rates of casting (under the present cooling conditions).,contradiction
"The last peak varies with the cooling rate of casting, which may be referred to the phase separation tendency of the alloy [25].",contradiction
"When the amorphous alloy is annealed below the T g, e.g. at 623 K for several hours, only structural relaxation is observed from the DSC curves, but no changes associated with crystallization can be observed in the X-ray diffraction patterns and the DSC curves.",contradiction
"When the amorphous alloy is isothermally annealed between the T g and the onset crystallization temperature T x, crystallization occurs after a period of incubation time, which is associated with an exothermic peak in the isothermal DSC curves, as shown in Fig. 2 .",contradiction
The incubation time and the duration of the exothermic peak become shorter with increasing annealing temperature.,contradiction
"The exothermic peak (Fig. 2) is related to the first crystallization peak, as shown in Fig. 3 .",contradiction
"After the exothermic peak (Fig. 2), the first crystallization peak (Fig. 3) is eliminated, which corresponds to a crystalline fraction of about 40% by comparing the crystallization enthalpy of the exothermic peaks.",contradiction
"After the crystallization associated with the first crystallization peak, the crystallization becomes very sluggish, with very slight heat output (Fig. 2).",contradiction
"With the extension of the annealing time, the second exothermic peak (Fig. 3) vanishes slowly and shifts to higher temperature (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 ).",contradiction
"For example, when the amorphous alloy is annealed at 673 K, the crystalline fraction reaches about 40% after annealing for 30 min and reaches only 50% after annealing for 120 min.",contradiction
The second exothermic peak in Fig. 3 is referred to the crystallization of the residual amorphous phase.,contradiction
"One indication is the endothermic peak ahead of the second peak after the annealing (Fig. 3(b) and (c)), which can be referred to the glass transition of the residual amorphous phase.",contradiction
Another indication is the HRTEM microstructures (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 ) which show larger amounts of crystalline precipitates after the elimination of the second exothermic peak than after the vanishing of the first exothermic peak.,contradiction
The high thermostability of the residual amorphous phase (associated with the second crystallization peak) may be attributed to: (1) The crystallization temperature of this residual amorphous phase becomes higher relatively to the annealing temperature (673 K); and (2) The crystallization temperature shifts to higher temperature as the crystallization proceeds (Fig. 4).,contradiction
"This crystallization behavior is unlike that of the classic amorphous alloy which crystallization temperature shifts downwards as the crystallization proceeds, e.g. the Fe?B?Si alloy [12].",contradiction
"Fig. 5 shows HRTEM images of the amorphous alloy after annealing at 673 K for 40 min, which corresponds to a state obtained after the first crystallization peak (Fig. 3).",contradiction
They show nanocrystals embedded in the amorphous matrix.,contradiction
The nanocrystals have a size of about 5?10 nanometers and are separated by the amorphous matrix.,contradiction
"Fig. 6 shows the microstructure of the amorphous alloy after annealing at 723 K for 40 min, which corresponds to a state after the crystallization associated with the second crystallization peak (Fig. 3).",contradiction
The nanocrystals have a size of 10?20 nanometers.,contradiction
"Comparing Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, one can see that some nanocrystals connect in Fig. 6 whereas the nanocrystals are separated by the amorphous matrix in Fig. 5.",contradiction
The relative intensity of the diffraction patterns indicate also that more crystals precipitated in the specimens depicted in Fig. 6 than in Fig. 5.,contradiction
The larger size of the nanocrystals in Fig. 6 than in Fig. 5 is due to the higher annealing temperature.,contradiction
Fig. 7 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the alloys heated up to a temperature before the third peak (823 K) and a temperature after the third peak (960 K) separately.,contradiction
The evolution of the microstructures of nanocrystals embedded in the residual amorphous matrix from the Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 amorphous alloy can be attributed to its following crystallization characteristics: (1) The crystallization occurs by steps; and (2) The residual amorphous phase (associated with the second crystallization peak) changes towards a higher crystallization temperature as the crystallization proceeds.,contradiction
"When the amorphous alloy crystallizes by steps, the crystallization steps (peaks) are usually associated with the formation of different phases [9, 26, 27].",contradiction
"Therefore, the primary precipitation of crystals is accompanied by composition partition.",contradiction
"For the Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 amorphous alloy, the composition partition causes the residual amorphous phase to have higher crystallization temperature and become more stable relatively to the annealing temperature (Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).",contradiction
It may be supposed that a diffusion layer will build up in front of the crystal-amorphous interface during crystallization due to the composition partition.,contradiction
"The concentration of the rejected components in the layer will first increase the crystallization temperature and thermostability of the amorphous phase in the layer regions, as a result, the growth of the crystals is retarded and the precipitated crystals are prevented to connect (when the residual amorphous phase has large volume fraction).",contradiction
This may be one of the reasons for the formation of the microstructures of nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous matrix.,contradiction
Bulk alloy of composite microstructures of nanocrystals and amorphous phases was produced by annealing the bulk Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 amorphous alloy prepared by copper mold casting.,contradiction
"The evolution of the partially nanocrystalline microstructures may be attributed to the following crystallization characteristics of the amorphous alloy: (1) The crystallization occurs by steps; and (2) The residual amorphous phase (associated with the second crystallization peak) changes towards higher crystallization temperature as the crystallization proceeds, which makes the residual amorphous phase more stable and limit the growth of the precipitated crystals.",contradiction
The fracture stress of the partially crystallized amorphous alloy increases with the crystalline fraction to ?45% and then decreases with further increase of the crystalline fraction.,contradiction
"The yield stress increases also with the crystalline fraction to ?45%, but then the deformation shows only elastic part and no yield point appears with further more crystalline fraction.",contradiction
Fracture morphology examination indicates that the fracture has ductile nature (e.g. with vein patterns typical for amorphous phase) when the crystalline fraction is <40%.,contradiction
"When the crystalline fraction is above about 45%, the fracture morphology has the brittle nature (e.g. branched cracks, mirror-like micro-surface).",contradiction
"The fracture surface has the mixed morphologies when the crystalline fraction is between about 40?45%, indicating the transition of the deformation nature.",contradiction
The Young's modulus increases with the crystalline fraction to 45% and then decreases.,contradiction
The microstructures of nanocrystals embedded in an amorphous matrix may be one of the contributions to the increase of the Young's modulus.,contradiction
The hardness increases linearly with the crystalline fraction from about 508 (HV) for the as-cast amorphous alloy to about 700 (HV) for the fully crystallized alloy.,contradiction
"A hypothetical CN2 structure was investigated as a model to study the release of N2 from the octahedral hole of 3D carbon based ultra hard compounds, which is the most important drawback in the attempts to synthesize ultra hard compounds like C3N4 and C11N4.",contradiction
Full structure relaxations using DFT methods led to a structure at the energy minimum showing a significantly enlarged N?N distance of 1.34 A? compared to the molecular N2 (1.09 A?).,contradiction
"While for small volume changes a high hardness for CN2 of 405 GPa is calculated, we found that enlargements of the cell constant lead to the release of N2 that could be followed calculating the ELF and the charge transfer within the AIM theory.",contradiction
The whole procedure simulates an inverted ?harpoon mechanism?.,contradiction
This paper investigates the range of possible elastic moduli of two-dimensional isotropic polycrystals.,contradiction
The polycrystals are comprised of grains obtained from a single orthotropic material.,contradiction
"The overall elastic properties are described by an effective bulk modulus K 0 and an effective shear modulus ? 0 The pair (K 0, ? 0) is shown to be confined to a rectangle in the (K, ?) plane.",contradiction
"Microstructures are identified which correspond to every point within the rectangle, and in particular to the corner points.",contradiction
Optimal bounds on the effective Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus follow immediately.,contradiction
"Under a certain constraint on the crystal moduli, the rectangle degenerates to a line segment: the effective shear modulus of such a polycrystal is microstructure independent.",contradiction
This extends earlier work that established microstructure independence for polycrystals constructed from square symmetric crystals.,contradiction
