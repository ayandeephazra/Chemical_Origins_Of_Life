the calculated a- and c-axial moduli  ma 0 and mc 0 in table 3  for this structure are very different from our experimental results  comparing values between tables 2 and 3   indicating that this structure is not suitable for modeling the observed elastic behavior of u3si5.,contradiction,99.657,contradiction,0.00343
in the a direction  there are u–u bonds directly along the a-axis  a component of the si–si bond  which is parallel to the  001  plane   and a component of the u–si bond  which is oblique to the a- and c-axis   all of which contribute to the linear modulus in this direction.,contradiction,99.557,contradiction,0.00443
thus  the contributions to the linear modulus along the c-axis would likely be different from those along the a-axis.,contradiction,99.739,contradiction,0.00261
although the details of evolution of the atomic positions with pressure have not been determined  it is qualitatively indicative that the lack of the stronger si–si bonds in the c direction is responsible for its greater compressibility.,contradiction,99.755,contradiction,0.00245
in this study  the high-pressure structural behavior of u3si5 was explored for the first time up to 16.7 gpa using high-energy angle-dispersive synchrotron xrd coupled with diamond anvil cell technique.,contradiction,99.648,contradiction,0.00352
moreover  our dft + u calculations yielded bulk and linear moduli that are comparable to the above experimentally determined values using the hexagonal structure  space group p6/mmm .,contradiction,92.043,contradiction,0.07957
although previous dft calculations also gave similar bulk moduli  the structural models used were inappropriate  as they do not reproduce the compressibility anisotropy between the a- and c-axis.,contradiction,98.357,contradiction,0.01643
finally  compilation of all the measured bulk moduli of u–si phases  including the value of u3si5 determined in this study  reveals that the bulk modulus of u–si decreases with increasing u/ u + si  ratio.,contradiction,97.968,contradiction,0.02032
experimental studies of ultrasmall nanodiamonds few nanometers in size revealed the increase of bulk modulus up to 20% [1].,contradiction,96.988,contradiction,0.03012
subsequent density functional studies seemed to support this claim and 17% increase of bulk modulus for subnanometer carbon clusters was reported [2].,contradiction,95.391,contradiction,0.04609
it should be noted  that on the basic level the bulk modulus b depends on the density of electron gas ρ according to the formula: b∝ρ5/3 [7 8].,contradiction,98.721,contradiction,0.01279
this means that 17% increase of nanodiamonds bulk modulus would involves corresponding increase of electron density and hence the decrease of interatomic distances.,contradiction,98.947,contradiction,0.01053
so  to simplify the problem  we propose to study the effects caused by surface reconstruction on the lateral properties of nanosized diamond films – change of it reticular density and the elastic modulus along the surface.,contradiction,99.721,contradiction,0.00279
the crystal lattices and atom positions at fixed external pressure were fully optimized  until residual force on every atom did not exceed 0.001 ry/bohr and additional stress – 0.5 kbar.,contradiction,99.674,contradiction,0.00326
thus total width was approximately 0.5 nm  and comparable to diameter of smallest nanoparticles investigated in ref. [2]  having the largest increase in bulk modulus reported.,contradiction,95.205,contradiction,0.04795
due to intrinsic complications  involved in applying uniform 3d stress on layered structures  we considered biaxial modulus instead of bulk modulus  which is the coefficient between the strain exerted along one axis in response to equal stress applied in two directions.,contradiction,99.146,contradiction,0.00854
for cubic crystals it can be expressed as: 1 m=e1−νwhere e is young’s modulus and ν is poisson’s ratio [10 11].,contradiction,99.651,contradiction,0.00349
biaxial modulus is directly measured in bulge test experiments on thin films [10].,contradiction,99.702,contradiction,0.00298
it can be compared to the bulk modulus  which under the same assumptions is equal to: 2 b=e3 1−2ν  in density functional theory calculations  the sum of two biaxial moduli of layered structure in two directions can be conveniently obtained as 2v∂σ/∂v by full structure relaxation of volume v upon application of pressure  stress σ   while keeping the size of supercell fixed in the direction normal to layers.,contradiction,96.902,contradiction,0.03098
in our case  biaxial elastic modulus was calculated by fitting the four values obtained for stresses between 0 and 30 gpa by three-order polynomial of σ vs. δv/v.,contradiction,99.626,contradiction,0.00374
as it was shown before  such a polynomial is an extension of birch-murnaghan equation of state for two dimensional materials [12].,contradiction,99.629,contradiction,0.00371
on the one hand  it can be regarded as biaxial modulus  measured in gpa  of 3d diamond-related structure where about one third of carbon layers were removed  or  alternatively  it can be related to the single diamond layer.,contradiction,99.671,contradiction,0.00329
in the latter case after multiplication of the superlattice period in the direction normal to layers and division by two  due to the difference in definitions  it yields elastic modulus which is named layer modulus  m2d measured in n m−1  [12].,contradiction,99.592,contradiction,0.00408
the values of layer moduli can be compared to corresponding experimental value of single graphene layer  340 n m−1 [13] .,contradiction,99.447,contradiction,0.00553
calculated layer modulus strongly depends on orientation of nanofilms  and the number of carbon layers  which  in our case  can be considered as an invariant between variously oriented planes .,contradiction,99.743,contradiction,0.00257
still  comparison of layer modulus for hydrogenated and bare  reconstructed  diamond films is nonetheless possible.,contradiction,99.65,contradiction,0.0035
such change of dimensions leads to the corresponding variation of reticular electron density which results in the corresponding variation of layer moduli: for  111  film we observed a 5% increase in the value of layer moduli and for  100  and  110  an almost 7% decrease.,contradiction,99.624,contradiction,0.00376
as it was shown earlier [5]  we should expect diminishing of dilatation  or contraction  of diamond films with increase of the film thickness  which should be accompanied by corresponding convergence of their elastic moduli to the bulk diamond one.,contradiction,98.933,contradiction,0.01067
however the direct comparison of calculated elastic modulus with the one of pure bulk diamond is more involved and requires appropriate scaling of so obtained layer modulus for its conversion into the biaxial modulus of diamond nanofilms.,contradiction,97.997,contradiction,0.02003
biaxial modulus is connected to layer modulus according to relation m=m2d/d where d is the thickness of the nanofilm.,contradiction,99.661,contradiction,0.00339
in this way we implicitly assume that linear electron density in the direction normal to layers is the same in the nanofilm and in bulk diamond.,contradiction,99.705,contradiction,0.00295
thus defined nanofilm thickness  measured from the middle of the slab  for hydrogenated and bare  111  nanofilms is around 3.18 å which is in the ±3 % range of “nominal” value 3.07 åṫhis means that indeed the linear electron density in nanofilms is approximately the same  as in bulk diamond and that correlation between in-plane dimensions and ratio of elastic modulus for hydrogenated and reconstructed diamond nanofilms  i.e. fig. 2  also holds for their “nominal” biaxial moduli.,contradiction,92.309,contradiction,0.07691
the errors involved in the usage of “nominal” biaxial modulus values is less than 3% and comparable to the error of the dft computations.,contradiction,99.679,contradiction,0.00321
for comparison we also provided calculated biaxial moduli of cubic diamond along corresponding high symmetry planes.,contradiction,99.593,contradiction,0.00407
for cubic crystal  the dft calculation of biaxial moduli using procedure similar to the described above  is impossible due to the lack of control over individual component of stress tensor  we need to apply special type of stress where two of diagonal elements of stress tensor are equal and the third is zero .,contradiction,99.582,contradiction,0.00418
so for calculation of biaxial modulus along high symmetry planes we use components of stiffness  or rather compliance  tensor.,contradiction,99.662,contradiction,0.00338
for calculation of the diamond biaxial moduli we used experimental values of compliance tensor sij  corresponding to experimental stiffness constants c11=1079 gpa  c12=124 gpa  c44=578 gpa [10].,contradiction,92.911,contradiction,0.07089
the stiffnes constants can be calculated by dft method using standard procedure of applying certain type of strain on diamond lattice but this routine leads to the variation of values within ±5 % range of experimental one [14].,contradiction,99.683,contradiction,0.00317
for hydrogenated films  obtained values of biaxial moduli match quite well with experimental diamond’s ones: for  111  film they are practically equal and for  110  and  100  films are about 10% less.,contradiction,99.56,contradiction,0.0044
the calculation of biaxial moduli enables one to estimate the bulk modulus of diamond nanofilms by combinations of eqs.  1  and  2 : 3 b=m 1−ν 3 1−2ν  for this purpose we have to obtain the estimation of poisson’s ratio of diamond nanofilms ν.,contradiction,98.436,contradiction,0.01564
under equibiaxial stress and with the same assumptions used in eqs.  1  and  2  the poisson’s ratio of the diamond films can be obtained from the variation of film’s thickness  δd  and the variation of its surface area  δs : 4 sdδdδs=−ν ̄1−ν ̄ this equation enables one to calculate average poisson’s ratio ν ̄ in two perpendicular directions along the film’s plane.,contradiction,99.668,contradiction,0.00332
so  we can conclude  that at the large extent the value of bulk modulus is determined by the change of biaxial modulus  which in its turn is caused by the increase in reticular electron density.,contradiction,99.232,contradiction,0.00768
thus  for ultrananodisperse diamonds we would observe dilatation due to the strain  exerted by the surface reconstruction and subsequently deterioration of their elastic properties  in comparison to the bulk single crystal diamond.,contradiction,99.634,contradiction,0.00366
it should be noted that increased lattice parameters calculated on the basis of x-ray diffraction experiments were reported for detonation nanodiamonds  2–12 nm [18]  5–7 nm [19]  with different prehistories and nanodiamonds  5 nm [20]  obtained by laser ablation.,contradiction,99.641,contradiction,0.00359
to conclude  our research demonstrated that the reconstruction of surfaces of nanosized diamond films leads to variation of their elastic moduli in the range ≈±5 %  depending on the orientation of the diamond film  in comparison to the pure single crystal diamond.,contradiction,99.681,contradiction,0.00319

while simulation results agree reasonably well with experimental elastic moduli  the effect of cross-section size contrasts experimental results.,contradiction,99.608,contradiction,0.00392
as observed by this study and several others  nanowire simulations consistently predict a reduction in elastic modulus with decreased cross-section [7 9 19 25].,contradiction,99.614,contradiction,0.00386
as stated prior  the source of this reduction is a higher proportion of surface atoms with respect to bulk atoms.,contradiction,99.676,contradiction,0.00324
in contrast  experimental data has suggested that a decreased cross-section will lead to an increase in the elastic modulus [4 6].,contradiction,99.691,contradiction,0.00309
similar to the keith 2010 reaxff potential  the baskes 1992 meam potential was also not parameterized with or tested against elastic constants and was only shown to be accurate with the shear modulus elastic modulus [22].,contradiction,99.534,contradiction,0.00466
after demonstrating the importance of potentials in obtaining an accurate elastic modulus  the next question was whether potential type was the source of discrepancies found in previous studies.,contradiction,99.581,contradiction,0.00419
moreover  elastic modulus was predicted to increase with increasing cross-sectional size.,contradiction,99.653,contradiction,0.00347
the study first attempted to verify the potential by testing the elastic modulus for bulk samples at various orientations.,contradiction,99.278,contradiction,0.00722

first  all simulations were conducted at 0 k  a non-realizable temperature that cannot be compared to room temperature experimental values where elastic modulus should be softened.,contradiction,99.412,contradiction,0.00588
next  the conclusion that elastic modulus was independent of cross-sectional size disagrees with previous literature on gold and metallic nanowires [7 9 19 25].,contradiction,99.637,contradiction,0.00363
it is the temperature of the nanowire that introduces a change in the surface energy due to the relatively high proportion of surface atoms to bulk atoms in the nanostructure.,contradiction,99.76,contradiction,0.0024
while this potential is not available specifically in lammps  it was developed based on the lattice constants and bulk modulus of fcc metals.,contradiction,99.184,contradiction,0.00816
therefore  while likely suitable for bulk materials  it was unable to accurately simulate the mechanical behaviour of nanowires.,contradiction,99.462,contradiction,0.00538
moreover  as opposed to comparing results against experimental nanowire values  the study compared nanowire modulus with bulk elastic modulus.,contradiction,98.624,contradiction,0.01376
the author’s concluded that error compared to bulk was a shortcoming of the potential used [7].,contradiction,99.622,contradiction,0.00378
however  error should have been compared with nanowire values where it would have been clear that modulus was being over predicted and not under predicted relative to bulk.,contradiction,99.142,contradiction,0.00858
in summary  the differences in both elastic moduli and the effect of cross-section appear to be a result of studies using unsuitable potentials for the task at hand.,contradiction,99.537,contradiction,0.00463
the choice of potential was commonly rationalized based on parameterization with bulk properties or  in the case of diao et al.  by testing the potential for bulk properties first [10].,contradiction,99.4,contradiction,0.006
while parameterization with bulk properties certainly does not guarantee accuracy  the highest errors appear to be observed for those potentials not parameterized with any elastic properties.,contradiction,99.442,contradiction,0.00558
therefore  the next step was to determine whether accuracy in simulating mechanical properties from a bulk sample corresponds to accuracy in simulating mechanical properties for a nanowire.,contradiction,99.478,contradiction,0.00522
a 15ax15ax15a cubic slab of bulk gold  where a is the lattice unit for gold  a = 4.0782 å  with periodic boundaries in the x-  y-  and z-directions was developed  equilibrated to 300 k using an npt barostat  and then strained in the [1 0 0] direction using the same strain rate as above.,contradiction,99.178,contradiction,0.00822

referring to table 3   as with the nanowire elastic modulus  the potentials predicted a wide range of elastic moduli from the atomistic tension test.,contradiction,98.842,contradiction,0.01158
moreover  both the meam and reaxff potentials again over predicted the elastic modulus and had significant error.,contradiction,99.637,contradiction,0.00363
therefore  those potentials without parameterization for bulk elastic properties were inaccurate for both nanowires and bulk samples.,contradiction,99.4,contradiction,0.006
in contrast  both of the eam potentials were parameterized with elastic constants and showed better accuracy to bulk properties.,contradiction,99.242,contradiction,0.00758

therefore  the potential most accurate for predicting elastic modulus from a uniaxial tension test of a bulk sample was not the most accurate for the nanowire.,contradiction,98.781,contradiction,0.01219
similarly  the foiles 1986 potential had an error of only 7% for bulk properties as compared to almost 20% for nanowires.,contradiction,98.483,contradiction,0.01517
therefore  while demonstrating accuracy for elastic properties of a bulk sample may indicate possible accuracy for nanowires  it is not sufficient to determine which potential is more accurate.,contradiction,99.436,contradiction,0.00564

therefore  the current study provided a detailed analysis into nanowires by considering how potential type  cross-sectional size  temperature  and equilibration method can affect the predicted elastic modulus of gold nanowires.,contradiction,99.72,contradiction,0.0028
accuracy at simulating bulk mechanical properties from uniaxial tension did not necessarily indicate accuracy when simulating nanowires.•discrepancies in elastic modulus in previously reported studies appear to be caused by the use of potentials that were not suitable for nanowires at room temperature.•both the foiles 1986 and olsson 2010 potential correctly predicted a trend of decreasing elastic modulus with increasing temperature and decreasing cross-sectional size.•the olsson 2010 potential was the most accurate and was parameterized with bulk elastic constants  surface energies  and thermal expansion coefficients at a large range of temperatures.•while reaxff offers the ability to model bond formation and breaking  it was the least accurate of all potentials tested.,contradiction,97.186,contradiction,0.02814

thus  the equivalent hydrostatic pressure  p  gpa  applied to crystals is  σxx + σyy + σzz /3.,contradiction,99.652,contradiction,0.00348

based on these setting  the effects of 9 different stress settings  including one that reflects hydrostatic pressure  on the structure and elasticity of quartz were calculated  with addition of σd in the amount of −0.5  −1  0.5 and 1 gpa respectively along a- and c-axis in each of these settings.,contradiction,99.547,contradiction,0.00453

the differences in the lattice constants  a  b  and c  under hydrostatic stress compared to non-hydrostatic stresses with σd were fitted by a linear equation and listed in table 1 .,contradiction,99.743,contradiction,0.00257
as shown in fig. 5  the differences of bulk moduli under non-hydrostatic stress from that under hydrostatic stress are very small.,contradiction,98.504,contradiction,0.01496
the differences of bulk modulus under hydrostatic stress compared to non-hydrostatic stresses are within the error.,contradiction,98.97,contradiction,0.0103
therefore the non-hydrostatic stresses nearly have no effect on bulk modulus of quartz.,contradiction,98.935,contradiction,0.01065
however  the shear moduli of quartz under non-hydrostatic stress differ from those at equivalent hydrostatic pressures.,contradiction,99.643,contradiction,0.00357
the differences of shear modulus under hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic stresses were fitted as fig. 6 .,contradiction,99.629,contradiction,0.00371
compared with their equivalent hydrostatic values  the increments of shear modulus under δσxx:δσyy:δσzz = 0:0:−0.5  −1.0  and =0.5  1.0 :0:0 conditions are respectively 1.1%  1.9%  0.6%  and 1%.,contradiction,99.047,contradiction,0.00953
this demonstrates that σd induced alternation of shear modulus depends not only on positive and negative character of σd but also equivalently on the axial direction that it applied.,contradiction,99.761,contradiction,0.00239
additionally  it is found that when the effect of σd on shear modulus of quartz is more significant when it is applied along c-axis than applied along a-axis.,contradiction,99.753,contradiction,0.00247

kcaf3 perovskite undergoes two first order structural phase transitions on cooling from the aristotype phase [1]  the first  at 560 k  involves the condensation of two zone-boundary phonons with irreducible representations  irreps  m3+ and r4+  the second  at 551 k  involves the condensation of a second mode with irrep r4+.,contradiction,99.632,contradiction,0.00368
the crystal system and space group of the room temperature phase was subsequently revised to be monoclinic  space group b21/m  non-standard setting of p21/m  [4]  however  high-resolution  time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction showed the revision to be erroneous  and that the space group of kcaf3 from 4.2 to 551 k was indeed pbnm [5] in agreement with the original analysis.,contradiction,99.443,contradiction,0.00557
in marked contrast to the well-studied compound rbcaf3  the structural phase transitions in kcaf3 have only been subject to limited investigation [6 7]  presumably this is due to the relative simplicity of the near-tricritical transition in the former  and the complexities of the first order phase transitions in the latter.,contradiction,99.546,contradiction,0.00454
however  consideration of the temperature dependence of the crystal structure of kcaf3 suggests that coupling between the two modes is probably only important close to the phase transition temperatures [5].,contradiction,99.755,contradiction,0.00245

single crystal neutron diffraction in the cubic phase at temperatures of 673 k  and 973 k showed evidence for significant anharmonicity in the behaviour of the fluorine anions  but no indication for the occupation of interstitial sites; the high conductivity was thus attributed to a small population of highly mobile f− vacancies [9].,contradiction,99.619,contradiction,0.00381
however the extremes of pressure required for stabilization of the post-perovskite phase of mgsio3 has led to significant research activity being expended on analogue fluoroperovskites phases in which the physical property under consideration  or the perovskite-post-perovskite transition  occurs at more easily accessible temperatures and/or pressures.,contradiction,99.632,contradiction,0.00368

the temperature variation of the volume strain  vs t   v t /v 0 - 1   is proportional to the internal energy u t   and the isochoric heat capacity  c v t   is equal the temperature derivative of the internal energy [49].,contradiction,99.732,contradiction,0.00268
this can be demonstrated by consideration of fig. 11 b in which the dashed line shows the poor fit to the isochoric heat capacity of kcaf3 to a debye model  363 7  k   note  the isochoric heat capacity was calculated from the experimentally determined isobaric heat capacity [27] using a standard thermodynamic transformation  in which we have further assumed that the bulk modulus is independent of temperature .,contradiction,88.632,contradiction,0.11368

the behaviour of rbcaf3 appears to be different to the other compounds  most probably due to the proximity of structural phase transitions at 200 k  pm3 ̄m–i4/mcm   and at ∼75 k  i4/mcm - pbnm; incomplete  [24].,contradiction,99.602,contradiction,0.00398
in non-magnetically ordered perovskite-structured oxide systems at low temperatures  the grüneisen constant increases with increasing temperature  before either exhibiting a broad maximum  catio3  lagao3  or plateauing  srzro3  baceo3  srceo3   unfortunately we lack isobaric heat capacity data for kcaf3 above 300 k and hence its detailed high temperature behaviour is unknown; the high temperature heat capacity measurements around the pbnm - cmcm and cmcm - pm3 ̄m phase transitions are regrettably plotted on an arbitrary scale [7]  and therefore cannot be analysed in this manner.,contradiction,99.596,contradiction,0.00404

the structural distortion induced by applying pressure is most easily appreciated by referring the unit cell to the pseudocubic subcell metric  which for a perovskite-structured phase with space group pbnm is monoclinic: a pc = b pc ≠ c pc  αpc = βpc = 90° ≠ γpc  transformation from the orthorhombic unit cell: 1/2  −1/2  0/1/2  1/2  0/0  0  1/2   and this pressure dependence is illustrated in fig. 4 .,contradiction,99.423,contradiction,0.00577

it is clear  however  that the measured bulk moduli do not correlate with the electronegativity of either the a  or b site  and neither is it correlated to the tolerance factor.,contradiction,98.946,contradiction,0.01054

the non-bonded interaction distances are found to be close to pressure invariant  with an average compressibility a factor of eighteen less than the average of the bonded compressibilities.,contradiction,99.648,contradiction,0.00352
due to all seven mode amplitudes having an appreciable pressure dependence  the characterisation of the structural basis for the bond compressibility in terms of the dominant mode contributions is significantly more difficult to derive than for measurements made as a function of temperature  where only a subset of modes generally exhibit a significant temperature dependence [40–43].,contradiction,99.638,contradiction,0.00362
both tilts are seen to increase in magnitude with increasing pressure  and this result is consistent with the observation that the effect of pressure is to increase the distortion of the crystal structure away from the cubic aristotype phase.,contradiction,99.736,contradiction,0.00264
within the caf6 octahedron  all bond lengths are found to decrease with increasing pressure  and unlike the effect of temperature  where the thermal expansion coefficient of the bx bonds is much less than the ax bonds  the b-site bond compressibilities in kcaf3 are similar to those observed for the a site.,contradiction,99.642,contradiction,0.00358

the crude measurements of polyhedral distortion  namely the quadratic elongation and the octahedral angle variance [44] are found to show no systematic trend with increasing pressure  and hence the caf6 octahedron remains relatively undistorted in the pressure range investigated.,contradiction,99.742,contradiction,0.00258

extrapolation of the unit cell volume of the high temperature cubic phase  phase field for t > 560 k  to 300 k suggests the volume of the kf12 dodecahedron at this temperature would be ∼70.27 å3  slightly larger than that observed in orthorhombic kcaf3  68.94 å3  that was calculated taking into account the four non-bonded interactions.,contradiction,98.911,contradiction,0.01089
according to the excess a-site free volume model of perovskite high pressure behaviour [47]  the evolution of the crystal structure of kcaf3 with increasing pressure should be one of reducing distortion with concomitant reductions in the magnitudes of the octahedral tilt angles.,contradiction,99.704,contradiction,0.00296

the significant differences in the compressibilities of the caf6 octahedron  and the kf8 polyhedron results in diverging bond valence differences with increasing pressure [52]  and on this basis  the structural deformation of kcaf3 should increase with pressure increase.,contradiction,99.743,contradiction,0.00257

therefore  a major objective of this work is to revisit the bulk modulus of u3si2 by performing in situ high pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction  xrd  [38–46].,contradiction,98.784,contradiction,0.01216
this method can characterize the intrinsic compressibility of u3si2 through determination of its pressure-dependent structural variation that is not susceptible to its bulk sample properties  such as porosity  grain characteristics  impurity and sample shape  each of which can affect the elastic parameters measured by rus [19 47].,contradiction,99.715,contradiction,0.00285

the unit cell volume–pressure relation can be fitted by the second order birch-murnaghan equation of state [65]: 1 p=3k02[ v0v 73− v0v 53]{1+34 k0−4 [ v0v 23−1]}where v 0 is the zero-pressure cell volume  v is the cell volume at a given pressure p  k 0 is bulk modulus  and k0 is the pressure derivative of k 0  which is fixed at 4 [65].,contradiction,96.89,contradiction,0.0311

the smaller value from rus is probably a result of sample-dependent bulk characteristics  such as weight  impurity  porosity  and symmetrical shape  which can all contribute to the underestimation [19 47].,contradiction,99.692,contradiction,0.00308
on the other hand  the rus result is of practical interest  as it reflects the engineering modulus of u3si2 materials from scaled-up fabrication whose microstructural defects and compositional variances cannot be effectively eliminated.,contradiction,99.7,contradiction,0.003
however  even though the method for obtaining k 0 in this work is immune to deviations caused by sample preparation or bulk defects  its accuracy still depends on the confidence of the determined pressures  the  quasi- hydrostaticity during compression or decompression  and the quality of the obtained high-pressure xrd data.,contradiction,99.419,contradiction,0.00581
one way to check the quality of the fitted eos is to compare the derived bulk modulus with that obtained by linear moduli through the relation [62] k0 lm=3⋅ 1ma 0+1ma 0+1mc 0 −1  where ma 0 and mc 0 are the linear moduli along the a- and c-axis  respectively  which define the linear compressibility at zero pressure.,contradiction,97.361,contradiction,0.02639
similar to the volume–pressure relation  variations of unit cell parameters with pressure can be fitted to the one-dimensional analog of the birch-murnaghan equation of state [39]  fig. 4  by replacing v in equation  1  with a 3 or c 3: 2 p=3ma 02[ a0a 7− a0a 5] p=3mc 02[ c0c 7− c0c 5] where a0 and c0 are unit-cell parameters at zero pressure.,contradiction,99.52,contradiction,0.0048

on the other hand  the bond interactions along the c-axis are more resistant to compression  as reflected by the relatively small changes in the projected distances of diagonal bonding interactions  u2 and other atoms  along the c-axis; these interatomic distances contract only by 4%–7% when pressure increases from 2 gpa to 30 gpa.,contradiction,99.634,contradiction,0.00366

the g  h  and f values at 30 gpa are larger than at 0 gpa  but s is smaller at 30 gpa than at 0 gpa  fig. 8 a  and  b    indicating that the thermodynamic stability of the b2 cuzr structure decreases with increasing pressure.,contradiction,99.697,contradiction,0.00303
the geometrical structures of the b2 and b19 cuzr structures under hydrostatic pressures in the range of 0 and 30 gpa were optimized  as shown in table 1 .,contradiction,99.731,contradiction,0.00269
comparing the calculated results at zero pressure with the available experimental data in refs.

the optimized volume v under applied pressure in the range of 0–30 gpa is also listed in table 1.,contradiction,99.757,contradiction,0.00243
with increasing the pressure from 0 to 30 gpa  the volume v of the b2 cuzr structure decreases from 34.977 to 29.154 å3  while the v of the b19 cuzr structure decreases from 70.642 å3 to 58.638 å3.,contradiction,98.375,contradiction,0.01625
the relative phase stabilities of the b2 and b19 cuzr structures expressed through the deviation of the formation enthalpies  △h  have been calculated by employing the following relation: 1 δhcuzr= etotal−ebulkzr−ebulkcu /2 where e total represents the total energy of a cuzr cell under different pressure  and e bulk zr and e bulk cu are the energy of a zr atom and a cu atom in the bulk state  respectively.,contradiction,99.59,contradiction,0.0041
it is apparent that the △h cuzr values of the b2 and b19 cuzr crystalline structures are negative under different pressures and increase with increasing pressure  implying that the stabilities of both b2 and b19 cuzr structures are reduced under high pressure.,contradiction,99.756,contradiction,0.00244
it should be noted that under pressures of 0 gpa the △h cuzr of the b2 cuzr structure is smaller than that of the b19 cuzr structure  while under pressures of 30 gpa the △h cuzr of b2 cuzr is larger than that of b19 cuzr.,contradiction,99.71,contradiction,0.0029
there must exist an intersection point of two △h cuzr –pressure lines for the b2 and b19 cuzr structures  i.e.  △h cuzr and pressures approximately are −2 kjmol-1 per atom and 27 gpa  respectively.,contradiction,99.55,contradiction,0.0045
this means that the b19 cuzr structure is more stable than the b19 cuzr structure when the pressure is less than 27 gpa  and when the pressure is higher than 27 gpa  the b19 cuzr structure is much more stable.,contradiction,99.717,contradiction,0.00283
the decreasing stability of both b2 and b19 cuzr structures and the different stability decreasing trajectories imply a high propensity of phase transformation from the b2 structure to the b19 structure.,contradiction,99.74,contradiction,0.0026

the elastic constants increase almost monotonically with increasing pressure  suggesting that the compounds are rather incompressible at applied hydrostatic pressures between 0 and 30 gpa.,contradiction,99.607,contradiction,0.00393
the highest c 44 values at 30 gpa for the b2 and b19 cuzr structures are 75.318 gpa and 97.06 gpa respectively  implying that their resistance to shear distortion is strongest in the  1 0 0  plane  as shown in table 3.,contradiction,96.923,contradiction,0.03077
besides c ij  also the bulk modulus  b  and the shear modulus  g  can be obtained by the voigt reuss hill method [25]: 3 b=12 br+bv   4 g=12 gr+gv  where r and v are the reuss and voigt boundaries  respectively.,contradiction,98.653,contradiction,0.01347

the bulk moduli b of the b2 and b19 cuzr structures change more significantly with pressure than g and e.,contradiction,98.496,contradiction,0.01504

in carbonophosphates framework  there exist vacant channel plus large [naon]  n = 6 7  polyhedron yielding major volume contraction  thus the [co3] triangles bears little pressure effect because they share only one o atom with [nao6] polyhedron [38]; whereas in calcite structure  the volume contraction is mostly realized by strong compression of [cao6] octahedron  which would induce more coordination number of ca2+.,contradiction,99.596,contradiction,0.00404

the mechanical properties  i.e. hardness  h  and the reduced youngs modulus  er   were evaluated in the direction perpendicular to the  001  basal plane.,contradiction,99.705,contradiction,0.00295
the reduced youngs modulus er  also called indentation modulus m  was obtained by the load-penetration depth curves  according to the model by oliver and pharr [54 55].,contradiction,99.657,contradiction,0.00343
in particular  the following equation was used: 2 er=m=sπ2a hc where s is the slope of the unloading curve at maximum displacement  while a hc  is an estimate of the contact area between the tip and the material  and it is function of the effective penetration depth hc.,contradiction,99.677,contradiction,0.00323
oliver and pharr described the unloading process as the contact of a paraboloid of revolution on a half space  and proposed the following equation for the evaluation of hc: 3 hc=hmax−εpmaxsmaxwhere hmax is the maximum penetration depth  pmax the maximum indentation load  smax the slope of the unloading curve at the maximum load  and ε is equal to 3/4.,contradiction,99.533,contradiction,0.00467
in order to compare the experimental value of the reduced youngs modulus er with that one expected by dft calculations  the mechanical anisotropy of snse has to be considered.,contradiction,99.644,contradiction,0.00356
this model directly relates the indentation modulus er = m to the elastic constants cij of an anisotropic material by a simple equation: 4 m=er=1πf cij where f c ij   is the first term of the fourier series expansion of surface greens function  which can be obtained from the elastic constants cij  for a detailed description of the function f c ij    see ref.

the elastic constants cij calculated by dft using different functionals  according to the procedure described in section 2.2  were then used to evaluate the theoretical value of the indentation modulus according to equation  4   and the value obtained for each functional was compared to the experimental one  calculated by equation  2   as explained elsewhere [57].,contradiction,99.605,contradiction,0.00395

the intrinsic values of youngs modulus and hardness which have to be considered are those reached after the fully plastic contact  when experimental values are stable.,contradiction,99.7,contradiction,0.003
however  whereas the er value stabilizes at 25 gpa at the maximum penetration depth reached during the indentation  the h value does not stabilize  and an evaluation of the material hardness cannot be pursued.,contradiction,99.672,contradiction,0.00328
a second set of csm nanoindentations was then performed with a higher load in order to obtain stable values of both youngs modulus and hardness.,contradiction,99.716,contradiction,0.00284
actually  a small decrease of both hardness and youngs modulus occurs in correspondence of a penetration depth of 200 nm.,contradiction,99.706,contradiction,0.00294
therefore  the measured values of 0.8 gpa and 25 gpa for h and er  respectively  can be considered reliable.,contradiction,98.987,contradiction,0.01013
such values were also verified by additional csm indentation tests performed at different loads  that led to the evaluation of the following average values and standard deviations: 25.3 ± 0.4 gpa for the reduced youngs modulus er  and 0.82 ± 0.03 gpa for the hardness h.,contradiction,97.879,contradiction,0.02121

concerning indentation modulus  it is evident from the comparison of experimental results in fig. 3 and theoretical predictions in table 2 that the agreement is missing for the eleven different exchange-correlation energy functionals used in our dft calculations.,contradiction,99.662,contradiction,0.00338
the deviation of the indentation modulus estimated by theory with respect to the experimental value is minimal for pbe-d2 and pbe-ts functionals  with an overestimation by about 25%.,contradiction,99.633,contradiction,0.00367
however  the presence of defects in the real samples inevitably implies an overestimation of the youngs modulus by theory.,contradiction,99.771,contradiction,0.00229
moreover  the comparative theoretical analysis in table 2 suggests that lda is completely inadequate for evaluating the youngs modulus of snse.,contradiction,99.729,contradiction,0.00271
it should be evidenced that our pbe estimation of the youngs modulus is much nearer to the experimental value compared to previous dft results by pbe  reported by li et al. [32]  which instead overestimate the youngs modulus by even 66%.,contradiction,99.675,contradiction,0.00325
on the other hand  our direct measurement of the youngs modulus is in agreement with the value obtained by an indirect estimation on the basis of the measurement of the longitudinal and shear acoustic velocities [60]  i.e. 27.7 gpa.,contradiction,96.772,contradiction,0.03228
it is worth mentioning that the unavoidable oxygen and carbon contamination in bulk single crystals of snse could be  in principle  one of the reasons of the deviation between experiments and theory  together with the remarkable amount of surface oxidation evidenced by xps  fig. 2 .,contradiction,99.695,contradiction,0.00305

based on the equilibrium wigner-seitz radii of ni-mo solid solutions obtained in our previous emto calculations [30]  the elastic parameters including equilibrium bulk moduli  elastic constants and shear moduli at 0 k were calculated first and compared with the vasp results obtained using 16-atom supercell models.,contradiction,97.741,contradiction,0.02259

the slopes of b 0 and c against mo concentration calculated by emto are almost the same with those using vasp.,contradiction,99.721,contradiction,0.00279

further results in shear moduli  bulk/shear modulus ratio  b 0/g 0  and elastic anisotropy constants  supplementary data table s1  indicate that higher mo concentration enhances the anisotropy and ductility of the ni-based solid solution with larger values of b 0/g 0 ratio and a g  in addition to its positive effect on the bulk modulus.,contradiction,99.051,contradiction,0.00949

the calculated thermal expansion with a linear coefficient of about 12.6 × 10−6·k−1 agrees well with the experimental value  14.1 × 10−6·k−1  [59]  while its equilibrium bulk modulus decreases by 12.5–18.7% with increasing temperature from 1000 k to 1400 k  fig. 3  .,contradiction,76.734,entailment,0.76734

despite the previous studies at high pressure provided a general view of the compressional behavior of ettringite  a description of the deformation mechanisms at the atomic scale is still missing  as the quality of the x-ray powder diffraction data at high pressure  coupled with the structural complexity of ettringite  hindered the structure refinements.,contradiction,99.642,contradiction,0.00358

however  angel et al. [12] described silicone oil as hydrostatic only up 0.8 gpa  and the poor data fit of cuesta et al. [10]  with one single function between 0 and 3 gpa  could be the result of using silicone oil out of its effective hydrostatic limit.,contradiction,99.507,contradiction,0.00493

these inter-atomic distances lie on the ab-plane and decrease pronouncedly in response to the applied pressure  e.g.  o9⋯o16 and o5⋯o15 decrease by almost 0.2 å   which is consistent with the fact that the linear bulk modulus along the c direction is almost twice that along the a  or b  direction.,contradiction,94.88,contradiction,0.0512

to describe the  isothermal  compressional behavior of ettringite  the unit-cell volume vs. pressure data were fitted  using the eos fit 7.0 software  to an isothermal birch-murnaghan equation of state  bm-eos   truncated to the second order in energy [17 18].,contradiction,99.611,contradiction,0.00389
this isothermal equation of state allows to obtain the isothermal bulk modulus of a given material k 0 [k 0 = −v ·  ∂p / ∂v p0  which is the reciprocal of the thermodynamic volume compressibility coefficient β0 = 1 / k 0 = −1 / v ·  ∂v / ∂p p0]  and its p-derivatives  k′ = ∂k 0 / ∂p  k′′ = ∂2 k 0 / ∂p 2 .,contradiction,95.445,contradiction,0.04555

the phase transition affects also the value of the monoclinic β angle: as shown in fig. 3  in the low-p form  β progressively increases from 109.37  1 ° at ambient pressure to 110.38  4 ° at 4.01  5  gpa; for the high-p polymorph  the β value appears to be nearly unaffected by p with an average value of 103.1°  ±0.2°   fig. 3  s2 sm .,contradiction,97.761,contradiction,0.02239
in order to describe the  isothermal  compressional behavior of both low- and high-p polymorph  the experimental v-p data  weighted by their uncertainties  were fitted to a third-order  bm3-eos  and a second-order  bm2-eos  birch-murnaghan equations of state [14 15]  respectively  using the eos fit 7.0 software [16].,contradiction,99.61,contradiction,0.0039
the high-p polymorph has a bulk modulus k v0  i.e.  k v0 = −v 0  ∂p/∂v p=0 = 1/βv0  where βv0 is the volume compressibility coefficient  ∼ 50% higher than that obtained for the low-p one  indicating a significant increase in stiffness in response to the phase transition.,contradiction,87.967,contradiction,0.12033

tilting of the zr-octahedra is the common deformation mechanism between elpidite and armstrongite  either at high temperature and high pressure [8  22 and this paper]   whereas the role played by ca  or na  appears to be only secondary in armstrongite at high pressure but it is critical in elpidite at hp and in armstrongite at ht [8 22].,contradiction,99.675,contradiction,0.00325

since the transformation strain is a function of the lattice constants of the two phases  the difference between the ldm and md values can be attributed to two reasons: 1  the ldm values are calculated from 0 k lattice constants  whereas the b2 and b19′ phases in the simulations are at 350 k; and 2  the lattice parameters of b2 and b19′  at 0 k  predicted by the meam interatomic potential are not exactly the same as the ab initio values used in the ldm.,contradiction,99.631,contradiction,0.00369

the other noticeable difference in behavior for the three orientations is in the nano-structural changes associated with the phase transformation.,contradiction,99.712,contradiction,0.00288
in the simulations presented here  the martensitic transformation occurs through the formation of such bands when the austenitic bulk is loaded both along the 〈110〉 or 〈100〉 orientation  whereas the transformation progresses through the formation of a multi-variant b19′ structure and the subsequent reorientation into a single-variant b19′ when loaded along the 〈111〉 orientation.,contradiction,99.663,contradiction,0.00337

in spite of the validity of the described scenario  it is well known that the maximum ionic conductivity values in bulk re-doped ceria occur within the f range  i.e. at x significantly lower than the one corresponding to the f upper boundary [7 17]  as a consequence of the formation of c-based nanodomains trapping vacancies at fixed positions  and therefore hindering their free motion.,contradiction,99.621,contradiction,0.00379

in particular  while the presence of a larger amount of defects in thin films with respect to bulk samples determines a remarkable decrease in ionic conductivity [25]  the reduction of the layer thickness generally promotes at the same time a significant conductivity increase  which is driven by the controlled interface lattice mismatch between the ionic conductor and the substrate [24 26].,contradiction,99.728,contradiction,0.00272
yet  the difficulty in performing reliable measurements at thin-film interfaces and in correctly evaluating the results by separating the two competing effects  namely the ones deriving from defects and from strain   suggests the possibility to simulate the lattice mismatch effects by following the structural properties of bulk samples subjected to high pressure.,contradiction,99.632,contradiction,0.00368

in this work  lu-doped ceria is taken as a model to study the high pressure structural features of a system where the effect of oxygen vacancies prevails over the ce4+/re3+ size difference in determining the cell parameters of the f phase; this occurs due to the close similarity of the ce and lu ionic radii with coordination number 8  rce4+ [cn8] = 0.97  rlu3+ [cn8] = 0.977 å  from [16]   which strongly reduces the dimensional contribution.,contradiction,99.6,contradiction,0.004
several compositions belonging to the f range of the ce1−x luxo2−x/2 system  nominal x = 0.1  0.2  0.3 and 0.4  are studied by high pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction employing a diamond anvil cell  dac   that is the most commonly used apparatus for high and extremely high pressure diffraction experiments [28].,contradiction,99.525,contradiction,0.00475
the applied pressure ranges between 1 and 7 gpa; this choice was operated relying on the evidence that a 1% compressive strain  which is for instance close to the one occurring in a 250 nm thick gd-doped ceria film deposited on a mgo/srtio3 layer [26]  roughly corresponds to the application of 5 gpa [27].,contradiction,99.531,contradiction,0.00469
two compositions mainly containing the c phase  nominal x = 0.8 and 0.9  are considered too  with the primary aim to check the c/f amount ratio obtained at ambient and at high pressures; moreover  the composition of the f phase in the  f + c  biphasic sample ce0.2lu0.8o1.6  primarily found by x-ray diffraction [12]  could be confirmed through the measurement of the bulk modulus.,contradiction,98.928,contradiction,0.01072

a monochromatic circular beam of wavelength 0.7 å and diameter around 50 μm was used; pressure was generated using a gear-driven boehler-almax plate diamond anvil cell  plate dac  with a large x-ray opening containing diamonds of culet size 600 μm.,contradiction,99.393,contradiction,0.00607
a tiny piece of oxygen-free cu was placed inside the chamber along with the sample to have a pressure calibration from the cu  111  diffraction peak position.,contradiction,99.682,contradiction,0.00318
the sample chamber was completely filled with silicon oil before bringing the diamonds of the plate dac in contact with the gasket: within the pressure range covered in the present study  maximum pressure applied ~7 gpa   silicon oil acting as a pressure transmitting medium  ptm  provided good hydrostatic pressure conditions.,contradiction,99.605,contradiction,0.00395
high pressure data are discussed in comparison to the ones collected on the same samples at ambient pressure at the mcx beamline  as described in [12].,contradiction,99.672,contradiction,0.00328
according to the results of the structural investigation described in [12]  at ambient pressure samples belonging to the ce1−x luxo2−x/2 system are monophasic and characterized by the fluorite structure up to x = 0.4  with only tiny traces of the c phase appearing in lu40.,contradiction,99.674,contradiction,0.00326
the amount of c increases with increasing x  until this phase becomes the most abundant one at x = 0.6  and the only one from x = 0.9. at x = 0.8  for instance  the sample is formed by the mixture  88 mol% c + 12 mol% f ; this evidence suggests the occurrence of out-of-equilibrium conditions  most probably due to a kinetic effect taking place during the oxalate coprecipitation stage  as elucidated in [12].,contradiction,99.634,contradiction,0.00366
the observed compositional extent of the f phase in lu-doped ceria points at a significantly larger stability field than in gd- and sm-doped ceria  where f was found stable up to x ~ 0.2 [9] and ~0.3 [10]  respectively.,contradiction,99.654,contradiction,0.00346
with regard to the biphasic sample lu80  the ambient pressure compositions of f and c were differently determined: relying on the interpolation of the refined f lattice parameter to the ones of the x = 0.1–0.4 series  the stoichiometry of f results to be ce0.67lu0.33o1.83; at variance  the composition of c was fixed at lu1.8ce0.2o3.1  i.e. the one corresponding to x = 0.9  since the c cell parameter of lu80 is very close to the one of lu90.,contradiction,99.379,contradiction,0.00621
in agreement with the previous description  three structural models were refined to properly describe the high pressure crystallographic features of the analyzed samples  namely the f model for samples with x ranging between 0.1 and 0.4  the c model for x = 0.90  and a  f + c  biphasic model for x = 0.80; in particular  for each composition atomic positions refined at ambient pressure [12] were used as the starting values for the refinement of high pressure data.,contradiction,99.522,contradiction,0.00478
the cationic ratio was set at the values found as previously described and not allowed to vary; in the last refinement cycle  structural parameters  lattice parameters  and in the c phase the ce/lu x coordinate and the o x  y and z coordinates   atomic biso  the scale factor  five peak parameters  two asymmetry parameters and the background points  were refined.,contradiction,99.606,contradiction,0.00394

the diffraction patterns of lu10 and lu90 collected at all the pressure values are shown in fig. 2  a  and  b  as representative examples of the behavior of phases f and c  respectively.,contradiction,99.741,contradiction,0.00259
it can be observed that no structural transitions occur up to the maximum applied pressure; a regular shift of all the diffraction peaks toward higher 2θ values with increasing pressure takes place in both phases  as highlighted by the dashed vertical lines appearing in the panels.,contradiction,99.695,contradiction,0.00305
by closer inspection  it can be also noticed that peaks present a progressive broadening and intensity decrease with increasing the applied pressure  which are typical of high-pressure data  see for example refs [27 34]. .,contradiction,99.683,contradiction,0.00317
in fig. 3 cell volumes are plotted for phase f as a function of pressure: in the range considered the decreasing trend can be properly fit by the regression lines drawn in the figure.,contradiction,99.668,contradiction,0.00332
it is noteworthy that the high pressure cell volumes from the different samples follow the same sequence as at ambient pressure; moreover  data of sample lu80 are located between the ones of lu30 and lu40  what confirms the substantial correctness of the lu content attribution  x = 0.33   done relying on ambient pressure structural data [12].,contradiction,99.661,contradiction,0.00339
no compressibility anomalies can be detected  at variance with the behavior of nanometric ce0.8sm0.2o1.9  which points at a negative pressure effect above 15 gpa [27]: it was attributed to the non-homogeneity of silicon oil acting as a ptm at pressures higher than 13 gpa [35]  causing a loss of hydrostaticity.,contradiction,99.606,contradiction,0.00394
based on these data  it is possible to estimate the bulk modulus  b0  of the f phase occurring at the different compositions  0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4   which is defined as 1 b0=−vdpdvp=0where v is the cell volume at p = 0.,contradiction,97.759,contradiction,0.02241
the bulk modulus accounts for the ability of a material to resist against compression  and its reciprocal represents the compressibility of the material.,contradiction,99.22,contradiction,0.0078
in fig. 4 the obtained b0 values are reported as a function of the lu content  together with the one of ceo2 retrieved from the literature [36]: it can be observed that the bulk modulus presents a trend to grow going from ceo2 to lu20  while it linearly decreases at higher x.,contradiction,98.235,contradiction,0.01765
it is noteworthy to observe that the bulk modulus of the f phase contained in lu80  set at x = 0.33  excellently fits into the linear trend  which further corroborates the correctness of the lu amount attribution based on the results of ambient pressure x-ray diffraction.,contradiction,94.488,contradiction,0.05512
it is also worth highlighting that the bulk modulus determined using a fit to the pressure-volume data using a second order birch-murnaghan equation also yielded a trend similar to that shown in fig. 4.,contradiction,94.536,contradiction,0.05464
the twofold behavior observed in the bulk modulus dependence vs. x  see fig. 4  can be interpreted by taking into account the most relevant factor contributing to the elastic properties of oxides  namely the mean atomic volume.,contradiction,98.895,contradiction,0.01105
according to the paper by anderson and nafe [38]  in fact  an inverse correlation exists between the bulk modulus of a metal oxide and its mean atomic volume; in systems such as doped ceria  where the total number of atoms changes with composition  this evidence means that the emptying of the structure  which crucially contributes to the mean atomic volume  is a significant factor in the calculation of the bulk modulus.,contradiction,98.756,contradiction,0.01244
as evident from fig. 5   the mean atomic volume of lu-doped ceria shows a linearly increasing trend as a function of the lu content; an inverse correlation can be thus observed with the bulk modulus values within the 0.2–0.4 x range  meaning that the introduction of vacancies plays a key role in this compositional interval.,contradiction,96.821,contradiction,0.03179
at lower x values  on the contrary  the slightly increasing behavior of b0 accounts for the decreasing trend of the lattice parameter vs. the lu content  thus indicating that the emptying of the structure becomes effective above a certain vacancies amount  while at lower lu amount the effect of the lattice size prevails; thus  below this threshold the bulk modulus acts as not perceiving the presence of vacancies.,contradiction,99.102,contradiction,0.00898
vacancies  which are typical of the f phase and dominate over c-based domains  lu′ce : v o ..  in lu-doped ceria at x ≤ 0.4  are supposed to favor an increase in compressibility of the whole atomic arrangement by causing the emptying of the structure.,contradiction,99.686,contradiction,0.00314
therefore  7.5 represents a threshold  below which the presence of vacancies reflects on the bulk modulus; above this value  on the contrary  they do not significantly affect it.,contradiction,98.205,contradiction,0.01795
with reference to the mean atomic volume of the lu-doped ceria system vs. the lu content  fig. 5   it is interesting to notice that the value associated to the f phase of sample lu80 well fits into the regression line  again confirming the accuracy of the composition found by x-ray diffraction.,contradiction,99.66,contradiction,0.0034
similarly to what was observed in this work  even in gd-doped ceria the bulk modulus shows a linear decrease with increasing the gd amount  which can be explained analogously to sm-doped ceria  see fig. 5 ; this behaviour is essentially different from the one of other moduli  such as the youngs and shear modulus  which display data lying above the linear fit observed up to x = 0.2  and consequently point at a stiffening of the structure at higher x [29].,contradiction,96.678,contradiction,0.03322
interestingly  both in gd- and lu-containing systems the bulk modulus seems not to experience the presence of c nanodomains  which in gd- and lu-doped ceria are revealed by μ-raman spectroscopy for x ≥ 0.2 [10] and x ≥ 0.3 [12]  respectively.,contradiction,98.115,contradiction,0.01885
at this stage it is interesting to notice that  at variance with the bulk modulus  the elastic modulus is commonly reported to be inversely proportional to the cell volume rather than to the mean atomic volume [29].,contradiction,98.854,contradiction,0.01146
as an example  when oxygen is subtracted from ceo2 or ce1−x gdxo2−x/2  for instance by treating samples at 1073 k at oxygen partial pressure lower than 10−17 atm [42]  which causes a significant off-stoichiometry   a certain amount of ce4+  rce4+  cn8 = 0.97 å [16]  is reduced to ce3+  rce3+  cn8 = 1.143 å [16]  to counterbalance the oxygen depletion; as a consequence of the increase in the average ionic size and the reduction of the coulomb interaction  the lattice parameter remarkably increases.,contradiction,99.489,contradiction,0.00511
this effect induces the decrease of the elastic modulus with decreasing po2 which is widely documented in the literature [42–44].,contradiction,99.749,contradiction,0.00251
an analogous decrease is revealed in y-  gd- and sm-doped ceria as a function of the re content  but only up to a certain dopant concentration  10–20% mol ce substitution  [45 46]; at higher doping ion content  on the contrary  it starts increasing even if the vacancies amount further increases  meaning that the elastic modulus value is bound not only to the vacancies content.,contradiction,99.625,contradiction,0.00375
hence  it can be concluded that the elastic modulus behaves in an essentially different way with respect to the bulk modulus  being the former strictly bound to all the factors contributing to the lattice size rather than just to the presence and the amount of oxygen vacancies.,contradiction,98.703,contradiction,0.01297
the high pressure structural features of several compositions belonging to the ce1−x luxo2−x/2 system were investigated by synchrotron x-ray diffraction coupled to a diamond anvil cell.,contradiction,99.683,contradiction,0.00317
the main conclusion which can be drawn from the results of the present study is that the trend of the bulk modulus as a function of the lu content results to be determined by two competing factors  namely the mean atomic volume for x ranging between 0.2 and 0.4  and the lattice volume at lower x; this result suggests that oxygen vacancies affect the bulk modulus value above x ~ 0.2. moreover  the bulk modulus seems to be independent of the presence of c-based nanodomains which are stable within the f structure starting from x ≥ 0.3. the observed trend is in agreement with data of sm- and gd-doped ceria available in the literature.,contradiction,98.019,contradiction,0.01981

as shown in fig. 1 b   the coordination environment of y  cr and o in scheelite phase is similar to that in zircon phase.,contradiction,99.706,contradiction,0.00294

the calculation reveals that ycro4 in zircon phase has lower total energy than in scheelite at ambient condition  and it also predicts a phase transition at 2.9gpa.,contradiction,99.689,contradiction,0.00311
our calculation reveals that the zircon phase has higher lattice energy than the scheelite phase  which means the zircon phase is more stable than the scheelite phase at ambient conditions.,contradiction,99.744,contradiction,0.00256
this is consistent with the results obtained by long et al. and li et al. [21–23] although ycro4 in zircon phase has high lattice energy  its bulk modulus is lower than ycro4 in scheelite phase.,contradiction,96.355,contradiction,0.03645
these results are not contradiction according to our theory because the bulk modulus of a crystal depends on the lattice energy density instead of lattice energy.,contradiction,99.274,contradiction,0.00726

later  a theoretical study was made by pandey and stoneham [6] who calculated the intrinsic defect energies using the well-known harwell hades program based on a generalized mott-littleton method.,contradiction,99.641,contradiction,0.00359
for example  the calculated h f values for schotttky pair formation were 2.42 and 2.29ev for lih and lid  respectively compared to the experimental values h f =2.33 and 2.40ev mentioned above.,contradiction,98.47,contradiction,0.0153
as we shall see below  this estimation makes use of the equation of state of lih determined by loubeyre et al.

the so-called cbω model [9–19] states that the defect gibbs energy g i is proportional to the isothermal bulk modulus b and the mean volume ω per atom  i.e.  1 gi=cibωwhere c i is a dimensionless constant practically independent of temperature  t  and pressure  p .,contradiction,98.442,contradiction,0.01558
among the applications of this model  we refer here to the most recent ones: first  katsika-tsigourakou and vassilikou-dova [20] by making use of the compressibility [21] of the defect volume [22–24] predicted by the cbω model  achieved in calculating the bulk modulus of a mixed alkali halide crystal in terms of the compressibility of the pure constituents.,contradiction,97.973,contradiction,0.02027
second  the same authors [25] relying on an interconnection between the ionic polarizability and the bulk modulus [26 27]  recently showed [25] that the considerable temperature increase of the static dielectric constant can be accounted for.,contradiction,99.109,contradiction,0.00891
by differentiating eq.  1  with respect to pressure and considering that the defect volume υ i is given by υ i = dg i/dp |t we find 2 υi=cidbdp|t−1ωwhich  when combined with eq.  1   leads to 3 υi=gibdbdp|t−1this relation interconnects υ i and g i through the bulk properties b and  db/dp |t that are involved in the equation of state.,contradiction,99.415,contradiction,0.00585
its value can be calculated from the relation s f = −dg f/dt |p considering that g f is given from eq.  1  and that b and ω depend on temperature.,contradiction,99.69,contradiction,0.0031

bulk acoustic wave  baw  properties of non- 002 -oriented aln [1–3] and zno [4] thin films have been reported recently.,contradiction,99.614,contradiction,0.00386
it was pointed out that the  103 -oriented aln thin films that can excite the fast quasi shear baw mode  velocity=5957m/s; k2=3.8%  along c-axis exhibit a great potential for film bulk acoustic wave resonator  fbar  liquid sensors.,contradiction,99.513,contradiction,0.00487

by averaging measurement data obtained over indentation depths ranging from 50 to 100nm  hardness of the  103  aln thin films deposited with rf powers of 150  250  and 350w is 14.92±0.93  14.28±0.47  and 18.91±1.03gpa  respectively  while youngs moduli are 168.89±5.99  162.59±6.84  and 242.26±8.92gpa  respectively.,contradiction,94.643,contradiction,0.05357
it is clear that the greatest hardness and youngs modulus of the  103  aln thin film was achieved with the rf power at 350w.,contradiction,99.679,contradiction,0.00321
heat release as well as the changes of the elastic moduli upon crystallization were reliably noticed already in the first studies of metallic glasses [1–4].,contradiction,99.71,contradiction,0.0029
in the liquid state  the large defect concentration provides both very low  but non-zero  shear modulus and related fluidity.,contradiction,99.659,contradiction,0.00341
on the basis of this assumption  we performed calculations [13] showing a direct connection between the change of the shear modulus of glass and heat effects occurring upon structural relaxation of glass below the crystallization onset temperature t c.,contradiction,99.657,contradiction,0.00343
in this work  we present similar calculations of the changes of the internal energy and elastic moduli occurring upon crystallization of metallic glasses.,contradiction,99.525,contradiction,0.00475
we performed a check of the derived relationship between the heat effect and change of the elastic properties upon crystallization using available experimental data on bulk zr52.5ti5cu17.9ni14.6al10 metallic glass.,contradiction,99.133,contradiction,0.00867
the elastic constants of interest can be accepted as [16]: the shear modulus g=ρ04∂2u∂ε122 and the longitudinal modulus cl=ρ0∂2u∂ε112  where ε 12 and ε 11 are the corresponding components of the strain tensor ε ij.,contradiction,99.554,contradiction,0.00446
we showed earlier [12 13] that the dilatation  volume change δv/v induced by frozen-in elastic dipoles  makes an insignificant contribution to the change of the internal energy and shear modulus at temperatures t < t c  we show below that this statement is also valid at temperatures above t c .,contradiction,99.618,contradiction,0.00382
in this case  i.e. provided that δv/v =0   considering only the first terms of the corresponding expansions  the expressions for the elastic moduli become: 2 g=μ+γ4ωti2   3 cl=λ+2μ+γ2+43γ3+2γ4ωli2 where ωt ≈1.38 and ωl ≈1.54 are the averaged dipole form factors for the shear and longitudinal deformations  respectively  see ref. [13] for details .,contradiction,99.484,contradiction,0.00516
then  using eqs.  2 – 4   one can write down the following relations for the change of the internal energy and elastic moduli  5 ρ0δu=μcλijλji ̄   6 g=μ+γ4ωtcλijλji ̄   7 cl=λ+2μ+γ2+43γ3+2γ4ωlcλijλji ̄.,contradiction,99.555,contradiction,0.00445
these equations show that the changes of the internal energy and elastic moduli with respect to the reference crystal are conditioned by the averaged quadratic form of the dipole λ-tensor and concentration c of frozen-in elastic dipoles  if c =0  then δu =0 and the elastic moduli are equal to those of the reference crystal   i.e. by the quantity cλijλji ̄.,contradiction,99.601,contradiction,0.00399
another important point is that the decrease of the shear and longitudinal moduli with respect to the reference crystalline state is conditioned by the fourth-order lamé elastic constants.,contradiction,99.727,contradiction,0.00273
the verification of the above equations was performed on bulk glassy zr52.5ti5cu17.9ni14.6al10  at.% .,contradiction,99.38,contradiction,0.0062
since the elastic moduli in the as-quenched state could be notably dependent on the quenching conditions [18]  for the verification we used the elastic constants determined for the relaxed glass.,contradiction,99.741,contradiction,0.00259
taking into account that the density upon crystallization of the glass under investigation increases by ≈2%  ref. [20]   the differences between the shear and longitudinal moduli in the crystalline and relaxed amorphous states are δg = 9.3±0.3 gpa and δc l = 16.9±3.5 gpa  respectively.,contradiction,96.77,contradiction,0.0323
for the theoretical estimate of this quantity  one needs to know the fourth-order elastic moduli γ 2  γ 3 and γ 4  which are so far known only for the only composition studied in the present paper.,contradiction,99.599,contradiction,0.00401
the heat of crystallization was calculated using the dsc data.,contradiction,99.713,contradiction,0.00287
to estimate the crystallization heat of the relaxed sample  we calculated the difference between the full heat effect  i.e. determined using eq.  10  with t = t f as the upper integration limit  and the heat effect reached upon heating the initial sample up to t g ≈643k  i.e. calculated with eq.  10  using t = t g as the upper integration limit .,contradiction,99.509,contradiction,0.00491
if one considers the elastic moduli  e.g. the shear modulus  then the most significant contribution into their change is connected with the terms linear in the dilatation [13 17].,contradiction,99.611,contradiction,0.00389
since the elastic moduli are determined from the measurements of the sound velocity  the magnitude of the effect is connected not only with the physical non-linearity  for the shear modulus  for instance  with the term ν2+43ν3δv/v  but with the geometrical non-linearity [16] as well.,contradiction,99.704,contradiction,0.00296
one should also take into account the method  which is used to derive the shear modulus change from acoustic measurements.,contradiction,99.735,contradiction,0.00265
upon in situ measurements  the magnitude of the relative change of the shear modulus is determined using the change of samples resonant frequency  f = v/2l  or the propagation time  τ = l/v with l being the samples dimension.,contradiction,99.709,contradiction,0.00291
in this case  the additional contribution into the shear modulus change connected with the dilatation is λ+43μ+ν2+43ν3δv/v.,contradiction,99.635,contradiction,0.00365
in the present case  we measured the absolute quantity ρv 2  which leads to the additional dilatation-induced contribution to the shear modulus change equal to λ+μ+ν2+43ν3δv/v.,contradiction,99.663,contradiction,0.00337
the estimate of this quantity using the third-order shear moduli determined in ref. [17] gives ≈−0.7gpa  which is also an order of magnitude smaller than the shear modulus change upon crystallization.,contradiction,98.56,contradiction,0.0144
for the longitudinal modulus  a similar relation can be derived.,contradiction,99.371,contradiction,0.00629
one has to conclude  therefore  that the disregard of the dilatational contribution upon calculating the internal energy and elastic moduli is quite justified  in line with earlier consideration [13].,contradiction,99.687,contradiction,0.00313
using eqs.  5  and  6  together with the experimental data on the crystallization heat and shear modulus change upon crystallization  one can estimate the fourth-rank elastic modulus γ4=δgqcμ=−220±40 gpa.,contradiction,94.413,contradiction,0.05587
this reasonably agrees with γ 4 =− 171±12 gpa obtained experimentally in ref. [17]  especially taking into account that only the first expansion terms were used to derive these equations.,contradiction,98.984,contradiction,0.01016
the averaged dipole energy can be calculated using eq.  9  as 11 ud=mμnaqcαi−1δv/v.,contradiction,99.68,contradiction,0.0032
taking the crystallization-induced dilatation of the glass under investigation as given above and assuming the characteristic relaxation volume α i for a dumbbell interstitial equal to 1.55  ref. [12]   the dipole concentration calculated with this α i using eq.  11  is about 3.7%  then with eq.  11  one arrives at u d ≈3.9ev  which is in general agreement with typical dumbbell interstitial formation energies in simple metals [25].,contradiction,99.445,contradiction,0.00555
using a non-linear representation of the internal energy associated with dipoles suggested earlier [13]  we calculated the heat release and changes of the elastic moduli occurring upon crystallization.,contradiction,99.734,contradiction,0.00266

the driving force for this structural transformation is the reduction in gibbs energy  g  from the original  phase 1  to final structure  phase 2 .,contradiction,99.728,contradiction,0.00272
the difference of transition pressures from phase 1 to phase 2 for both bulk and nanocrystals was derived as: 3 pnt-pbt=pbt δvb pbt /δvn pnt -1 + unsurf 2 pnt -unsurf 1 pnt  /δvn pnt +  ub 1 pbt -ub 1 pnt  - ub 2 pbt -ub 2 pnt   /δvn pnt  where b and n refer to bulk and nanocrystals  respectively  unsurf is the internal surface energy per mole  u b is the internal energy in bulk  p is the pressure  v n is the volume per mole  δvn pnt =vn 1 pnt -vn 2 pnt  and δvb pbt =vb 1 pbt -vb 2 pbt  [157].,contradiction,99.307,contradiction,0.00693
from the expression  it is clear that the transition pressure  pnt  in nanocrystals depends on three components:  1  the volume change for bulk and nanocrystals at transitions   hereafter  is denoted as term 1 ;  2  the surface energy difference between the phases involved   hereafter  is denoted as term 2 ; and  3  the internal energy difference between the phases involved in bulk   hereafter  is denoted as term 3 .,contradiction,99.637,contradiction,0.00363
thus  it is seen from fig. 5 that as the crystallite size decreases  the transition pressure increases.,contradiction,99.71,contradiction,0.0029
the driving force for the enhancement of transition pressure in nanocrystalline sno2 samples is mainly due to the term 2  the surface energy differences  although the term 1 favors a reduction of the transition pressure.,contradiction,99.751,contradiction,0.00249

by setting the chemical potential equal in eq.  4   it can be shown that 12 ulp pbt -uhp pbt =-pbt[vlp pbt -vhp pbt ]so  the last two terms in eq.  11  can be calculated from the bulk sno2 phase transition pressure and the volume change at transition in the bulk system.,contradiction,99.678,contradiction,0.00322

recently  several expressions for the temperature dependence of thermal expansion of ionic solids have been developed: shanker et al. [3 4] presented a formulation based on the power series expansion of lattice potential energy extending the method originally due to born and huang [1]; pandey [5] developed an expression using the assumption that the coefficient of volume thermal expansion α is a quadratic function of temperature; singh and chauhan [2] put forward a relation based on the modification of the expression given by anderson [6] for linear variation of α with temperature at higher temperatures; and kushwah et al. [7] obtained a relation on the basis of the two assumptions that the product of the coefficient of volume thermal expansion α and the isothermal bulk modulus kt is constant and the chopelas–boehler approximation  i.e.  the isothermal anderson–gruneisen parameter varies linearly with temperature  holds.,contradiction,99.626,contradiction,0.00374
and in section 3  the predicted values of v/v 0 of nacl and kcl crystals from room temperature to temperatures close to their melting points are calculated with this developed relation; the calculated results given by this relation and the other similar expressions are compared with the experimental data.,contradiction,99.638,contradiction,0.00362
using the definition of thermal expansivity α α=1v dvdt p in relation  6   we get the following differential equation: 7 dvdt=c0kt.for integrating eq.  7  along an isobar  we require a knowledge of the temperature dependence of isothermal bulk modulus.,contradiction,98.823,contradiction,0.01177
in this paper  the following linear relationship for the variation of isothermal bulk modulus kt with temperature t is taken: 8 kt=kt0[1-α0δ0 t-t0 ] where δ0  kt 0  and α0 are  respectively  the isothermal anderson–gruneisen parameter  the isothermal bulk modulus  and the thermal expansivity all at room temperature t0=300k and zero pressure.,contradiction,96.868,contradiction,0.03132
substituting eq.  8  into  7  and taking into account that the constant c 0 may be written as c0=α0kt0v0 in terms of relation  6   we get the following expression for the temperature dependence of volume thermal expansion of alkali halides by integrating eq.  7  over temperature at ambient pressure  p=0 : 9 vv0=1-1δ0ln[1-α0δ0 t-t0 ] where v 0 is the volume at the reference temperature t 0.,contradiction,99.591,contradiction,0.00409
the calculated results for nacl and kcl crystals with eq.  9  from room temperature to that close to the melting temperatures are reported in tables 2 and 3 .,contradiction,99.714,contradiction,0.00286
hence  the calculated results reported by kushwah and shanker [4] with the following expression 10 vv0=1-[1-2 kt0′+1 kt0pth]1/2kt0′+1+1 and obtained from the relation suggested by kushwah et al. [7] in the following form  11 vv0=1-1δ0+1ln[1-α0 δ0+1  t-t0 ] are all presented in tables 2 and 3 for the sake of comparison.,contradiction,99.602,contradiction,0.00398

tables 2 and 3 clearly shows that when the temperature is not too high from room temperature  the calculated results obtained from any of the three equations for volume thermal expansion of nacl and kcl crystals agree with the experimental data well  but at higher temperatures  the results obtained from eq.  9  present better agreement with the experimental ones compared with those from eqs.  10  and  11 .,contradiction,99.623,contradiction,0.00377
in terms of eq.  6   the product of the coefficient of volume thermal expansion α and the isothermal bulk modulus kt is inversely proportional to the volume  or equivalently the product αktv is constant.,contradiction,98.208,contradiction,0.01792
this is significantly different from the assumption  i.e. the product of αkt is a constant  that appeared frequently in the literature [6] and taken by shanker et al. [3 4] for the thermal pressure p th  see eq.  12   in eq.  10  and kushwah et al. [7] for getting eq.  11 .,contradiction,99.594,contradiction,0.00406
very recently  singh et al. [18] examined some approximations for the relation between the coefficient of volume thermal expansion α  the isothermal bulk modulus kt   and the volume v.,contradiction,98.689,contradiction,0.01311
in addition  the thermal pressure given by eq.  12  with a constant αkt would be overestimated at higher temperatures if the fact that the product αkt decreases with temperature above the debye temperature is considered.,contradiction,99.712,contradiction,0.00288
efforts to modify the linear relation for thermal pressure by taking into account the variation of the product αkt with volume have also been made [19 20].,contradiction,99.727,contradiction,0.00273
in view of these facts  we may conclude that the assumption that αkt is constant is a main factor leading to a larger discrepancy between the experimental data and the calculated results obtained  respectively  from eqs.  10  and  11  at higher temperature  as shown in tables 2 and 3.,contradiction,99.694,contradiction,0.00306

this could be understood as follows: eq.  2  can be alternatively written as 6 ci= υi/ω / db/dp|t-1  note that eq.  6  still holds irrespective if the right-hand side of eq.  1 —and hence that of eq.  3 —has an additional constant λ which does not vary with pressure  see chapter 14 of ref.

for the partially crystallized alloys  the precipitated crystals and the residual amorphous phase  due to the composition changes  may have different youngs modulus from the original amorphous phase  causing the variation of the youngs moduli with the crystalline fraction.,contradiction,99.74,contradiction,0.0026
however  one may notice the fact that the variation of the youngs moduli  fig. 13  is consistent with variation of the yield stress  fig. 11  and the fracture stress  fig. 12  which are closely associated with the microstructures of the partially crystallized alloys.,contradiction,99.72,contradiction,0.0028

the high thermostability of the residual amorphous phase  associated with the second crystallization peak  may be attributed to:  1  the crystallization temperature of this residual amorphous phase becomes higher relatively to the annealing temperature  673 k ; and  2  the crystallization temperature shifts to higher temperature as the crystallization proceeds  fig. 4 .,contradiction,99.657,contradiction,0.00343
the evolution of the microstructures of nanocrystals embedded in the residual amorphous matrix from the zr57cu20al10ni8ti5 amorphous alloy can be attributed to its following crystallization characteristics:  1  the crystallization occurs by steps; and  2  the residual amorphous phase  associated with the second crystallization peak  changes towards a higher crystallization temperature as the crystallization proceeds.,contradiction,99.662,contradiction,0.00338

in contrast  our dft + u calculations using the structural models shown in fig. 5 a  and  c  reproduced the anisotropic behavior and yielded bulk modulus values of 108.5 gpa and 114.5 gpa  respectively  which are both in good agreement with the experimental value.,entailment,98.89,entailment,0.9889

recently  the bulk modulus of gdbo3 was reported by woźny et al. in ref. [11] to be 326 gpa  which the authors allege supports the earlier reported value of 321 gpa by wang et al. in ref. [12].,entailment,99.157,entailment,0.99157
the experimental results of ref. [12] pertaining to gdbo3 attracted close criticism from ref.

in this work  through careful data acquisition and analysis  whereby non-hydrostatic data are identified and disregarded  the bulk modulus of gdbo3 was determined to be 170 13  gpa  which is in good agreement expected values based on compressibility systematics of orthoborates and with the predicted value of 135 gpa of ref. [14]  and is approximately 50% of the overestimated value of 326 gpa of ref. [11]  and of 321 of ref. [12].,entailment,98.303,entailment,0.98303
the bulk modulus of the micro-ybo3 samples in our previous work was determined to be 164 8  gpa.,entailment,99.507,entailment,0.99507

the main focus of woźny et al. in ref.

in fig. 3 b  the gdbo3 data of the present work  shown in black  are very well fitted with a bulk modulus of 170 13  gpa.,entailment,99.359,entailment,0.99359
the data of woźny et al.  shown in red  have here been refitted with a bulk modulus of 95 13  gpa.,entailment,99.215,entailment,0.99215
there are three important remarks: firstly that the alleged gdbo3 bulk modulus of 326 gpa is not compatible with their data; secondly  that in any case such a large bulk modulus is not compatible with the known compressibility systematics of isomorphic borates [26]; and thirdly  that the low bulk modulus of 95 13  gpa re-fitted here drastically underestimates the bulk modulus of gdbo3.,entailment,97.541,entailment,0.97541
numerous different equation of state have been fitted to their data using their reported values of v 0 = 230:77 å and b 0 = 27:09 gpa as fixed parameters  as shown in supplementary fig. 7  however we were not able to reproduce the reported eos.,entailment,97.862,contradiction,0.02138
relaxing the fixed parameters results in converged fit with a very low bulk modulus of 19 3  gpa  which describes the data very closely but still raises concerns.,entailment,99.044,entailment,0.99044
for example  a bulk modulus of 19 3  gpa would suggest that the triclinic gdbo3 compound is as compressible as a rare-gas solid  which cannot be the case.,entailment,98.927,entailment,0.98927
as shown in fig. 2 a   second-order birch-murnaghan  bm  equations of state  eos  provide excellent fits to the data below the aforementioned quasihydrostatic limits  providing isothermal bulk moduli [22] of b 0 = 170 13  and 163 13  gpa for gdbo3 and ybo3 respectively  where the bulk modulus  b  is given by  b = −vδp/δv.,entailment,99.046,entailment,0.99046
using the same input data and type of eos  the pascal principal axis strain calculator [23] calculates very similar bulk moduli of 170 2  and 163 1  gpa for gdbo3 and ybo3 respectively.,entailment,98.958,entailment,0.98958
in particular  the fundamental property of bulk modulus was found to be 170 13  and 163 13  gpa for gdbo3 and ybo3 nanocrystals respectively  thereby revealing that the compressional behaviour of both compounds is consistent with the family of borate compounds.,entailment,99.267,entailment,0.99267
the ab initio calculations of ref. [14] predicted a gdbo3 bulk modulus of 135 gpa  which consistent with the results presented here  and those expected based on observed compression systematics based on metallic cationic radius [26].,entailment,99.246,entailment,0.99246
this study concludes that the claims of gdbo3 incompressibility made by other authors are not correct  in particular that the gdbo3 bulk modulus values of 326 gpa reported in ref. [11]  and of 321 gpa in ref. [12]  are overestimated by a factor of approximately 2.,entailment,98.637,entailment,0.98637
the ybo3 bulk modulus determined here  163 13  gpa  agrees very closely with our previous result [13] on ybo3 micro-powders of 164 8  gpa  and shows that in the case of these rare-earth orthoborates optimisation of powder xrd experiments is possible through the use of nano-powder samples without affecting the observed compressional behaviours.,entailment,96.088,entailment,0.96088
