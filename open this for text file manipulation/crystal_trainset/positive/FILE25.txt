As shown in Fig. 2(a), second-order Birch-Murnaghan (BM) equations of state (EOS) provide excellent fits to the data below the aforementioned quasihydrostatic limits, providing isothermal bulk moduli [22] of B 0 = 170(13) and 163(13) GPa for GdBO3 and YBO3 respectively, where the bulk modulus, B, is given by, B = ?V?P/?V.
