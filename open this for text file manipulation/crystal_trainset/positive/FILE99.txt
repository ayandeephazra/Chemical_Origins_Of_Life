The bulk modulus at room temperature derived from the present study is very consistent with the value reported by previous studies (K T0 =61.0GPa and KT0?=6.7 in Bezacier et al., 2013; K T0 =62.0GPa and KT0?=6.4 in Hilairet et al., 2006a; K T0 =62.9GPa and KT0?=6.1 in Nestola et al., 2010) within uncertainty.
