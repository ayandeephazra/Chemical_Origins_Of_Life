From the F E?f E plot construction, we can also obtain a bulk modulus of 131.1(4) GPa (the intercept of the straight line in Fig. 3) accompanied by a first pressure derivative, K?, calculated by the straight line slope as: slope = 3K T0(K??4)/2 (see [25] for more details), providing a value of 3.3(2) and indicating a very good agreement between the refined and the experimental EoS coefficients.
