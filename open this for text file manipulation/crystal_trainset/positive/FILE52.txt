From the results of these previous studies, the anhydrous pyrope bulk modulus and its pressure derivative are within the ranges of K 0 =170?175GPa and K?0 =3.2?5.3. However, we obtained the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative as K 0 =161GPa and K?0 =5.0 for the hydrous pyrope (about 900ppmw) in this study.
