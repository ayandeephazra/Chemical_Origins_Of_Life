Synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements have been made [2] on solid 7LiH up to 36GPa and solid 7LiD up to 94GPa by using helium as a hydrostatic medium and reported that the rock?salt structure is stable up to the maximum pressure and that at ambient conditions the isothermal bulk modulus is B I=32.2GPa and its pressure derivative dB I/dP=3.53.
