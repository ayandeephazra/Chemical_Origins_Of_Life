Moreover, a remarkable change of the ?axial bulk moduli? (calculated simply by substituting the cube of the individual lattice parameter a 3, b 3, c 3 for the volume in the EoS) [15] occurs from the low-to the high-P polymorph: K b and K c increase from 23 to 50 GPa and from 26 to 46 GPa, respectively, whereas K a falls from 78 to 35 GPa.
