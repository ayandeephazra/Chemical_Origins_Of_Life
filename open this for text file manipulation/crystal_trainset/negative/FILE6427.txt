Recently, experimental studies of the mechanical properties of phase D have shown that LVZ, shear splitting delay times as well as the splitting geometry V SH > V SV observed in the northern part of the Tonga subduction zone at ULM mantle depths could be explained by the presence of 16vol.% of textured phase D in a hydrous subducted peridotite containing 1.2wt.% of water (Rosa et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2012).
