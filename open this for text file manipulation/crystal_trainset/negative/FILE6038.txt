In addition, while performing full geometry optimization the allowed root-mean-square values of energy gradients and nuclear displacements were correspondingly tightened to 0.00006 and 0.00012a.u. In order to improve the self-consistence field convergence, the Kohn?Sham matrix mixing technique (at 80%) together with Anderson?s method [21] were applied.
