Besides the conventional strongly covalent superhard compounds (diamond, c-BN, BC2N, etc.) formed by the light elements, namely, B, C, N, and O, the interaction of these lights elements into the transition metal (TM) to form strong covalent bonds yet keeping a high valence-electron density (VED) and bulk moduli, is a well-known strategy for designing new potential superhard materials suggested by Kaner et al. [1,2].
