By meanings of Eqs. (1) and (2), the crystal formula of RECrO4 compounds can be decomposed into three sub-formulas:(15)RECrO4=RE1/2O4/31+RE1/2O4/32+Cr1O4/3 On the basis of the sub-formula equation, the chemical bond parameters, lattice energies, LTECs and bulk moduli of the chemical bonds in RECrO4 are calculated by using the method shown in Section 2.
