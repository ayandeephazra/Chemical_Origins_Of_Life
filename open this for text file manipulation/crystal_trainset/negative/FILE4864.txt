For direct comparison, seismic profiles of major minerals in upper-mantle eclogite and peridotite rock assemblages were calculated including olivine (Isaak, 1992; Zha et al., 1998; Liu and Li, 2006), clinopyroxene (Cameron, 1973; Finger and Ohashi, 1976; Duffy and Anderson, 1989; Collins and Brown, 1998), orthopyroxene (Chai et al., 1997; Jackson et al., 2003, 2007), and garnet (Thieblot et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2013) (Fig. 8).
