Yet, the difficulty in performing reliable measurements at thin-film interfaces and in correctly evaluating the results by separating the two competing effects (namely the ones deriving from defects and from strain), suggests the possibility to simulate the lattice mismatch effects by following the structural properties of bulk samples subjected to high pressure.
