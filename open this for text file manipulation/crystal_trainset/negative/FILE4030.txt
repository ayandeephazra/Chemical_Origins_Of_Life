Ettringite shows a significant anisotropic compressional pattern, with K(c)0 ~ 2K(a,b)0 (being the axial moduli defined as K j0 = 1 / 3?j0 = ?1 / 3l j ú (?l j / ?P)P0, with l j as a given unit-cell edge length), in fair agreement with the previous high-pressure investigations and simulations (Table 4).
