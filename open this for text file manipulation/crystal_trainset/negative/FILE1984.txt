The total purified water mass and the mass of the plate ice produced during the freezing process were monitored using a Precisa BJ2200C precision balance (resolution 0.01 g) to determine the ice growth rates (2.78ú10-7ms-1 and 850 gh-1m-2) and the mass loss rate caused by evaporation and sublimation (75 gh-1m-2).
