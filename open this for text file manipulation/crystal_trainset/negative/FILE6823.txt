The relevant volume equations needed to calculate the first term in Eq. (7) for each phase are(9)Vlp(PnT,rlp)=V0,lp1+B0?B0,lpúp+2?lprlp1/B0? (10)Vhp(PnT,rhp)=V0,hp1+B0?B0,hpúp+2?hprhp1/B0?The second term in Eq. (7) is broken into two parts to obtain numerical values,(11)Ulp(PnT)-Uhp(PnT)=[Ulp(PnT)-Ulp(PBT)]-[Uhp(PnT)-Uhp(PBT)]+Ulp(PBT)-Uhp(PBT)where P BT is the bulk phase transition pressure.
