Using isothermal curves (F (V, T)-V), the equilibrium volumes at different temperatures can be readily obtained from Birch-Murnaghan equation of state [24].(1)E(V)=BoVoB0?[1B0??1(VVo)(1?B0?)+VVo+B0?1?B0?]+Eo In order to evaluate the thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of R2O3 (R=Y, La) at a constant pressure, the Gibbs free energy was calculated by G (P, T)=F(V, T)+PV.
