Here we report for the first time the P?V?T data of natural antigorite, which were measured in situ by using energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction in a cubic type multi-anvil apparatus, MAX80, at the Photon Factory-Advanced Ring (PF-AR), High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), up to ?10GPa and 500øC based on a series of direct measurements.
