In addition to the bulk modulus of GdBO3, we also calculated for the first time the individual axial compressibilities via the isothermal compressibility tensor [24] (see Supplementary Table 3) which reveals an anisotropic compressibility in GdBO3 essentially identical to that exhibited by YBO3 in our previous work [13] and which we rationalised in terms of the compressibilities of the constituent BO4-tetrahedra and AO8-dodecahedra.
