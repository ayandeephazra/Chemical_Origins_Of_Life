Several compositions belonging to the F range of the Ce1?x LuxO2?x/2 system (nominal x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) are studied by high pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction employing a diamond anvil cell (DAC), that is the most commonly used apparatus for high and extremely high pressure diffraction experiments [28].
