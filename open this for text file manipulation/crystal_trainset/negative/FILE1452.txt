The results got on the z-axis deformation has successfully determined the relationship between modulus of elasticity (E), shear elasticity modulus (G) and constants of deformation (?) with deformation of Ni nanowire has low stress at the amorphous state and high stress at the crystalline state and the stress at the amorphous state can change continuously when at constant temperature [5?7,43], results consistent with the results of Cu nanowire [44?46].
