The specification of these two subspaces depends on the value of stiffness distributor ? (more details can be found in Appendix A),?the two-dimensional subspace of in-plane pure shears (i.e. pure shears in the isotropy plane which is a plane perpendicular to c axis),?the two-dimensional subspace of out-of-plane pure shears (i.e pure shears in the plane containing c axis).
