To obtain the equilibrium lattice volume as a function of temperature, we have calculated the static energy U(V)0 and vibrational free energy F ph(V, T) at temperatures varying from 0 to 1000K with a step of 100K at 11vol points, and these procedures are applied for mackinawite (FeS) and pyrite (FeS2) with the results shown in Fig. 4.
