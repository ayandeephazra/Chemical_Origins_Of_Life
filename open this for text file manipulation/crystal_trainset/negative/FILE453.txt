Under equibiaxial stress and with the same assumptions used in Eqs. (1) and (2) the Poisson?s ratio of the diamond films can be obtained from the variation of film?s thickness (?d) and the variation of its surface area (?S):(4)Sd?d?S=?? ?1?? ? This equation enables one to calculate average Poisson?s ratio ? ? in two perpendicular directions along the film?s plane.
