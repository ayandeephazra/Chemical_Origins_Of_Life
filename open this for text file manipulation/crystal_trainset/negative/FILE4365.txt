What happens at higher RE content is quite complicated and strongly dependent on the Ce4+/RE3+ size difference [13]: if a sufficient dimensional resemblance exists, such as in the case of RE ? Gd, Sm and Y, an intermediate structure between F and the one typical of sesquioxides RE2O3 of the smallest rare earths becomes stable.
