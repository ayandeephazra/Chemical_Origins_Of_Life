The LTEC of a complex crystal can be estimated from the following expressions,(10)?=??Fmn??mn?(10-6/K) (11)?mn?=-3.1685+0.8376?mn?(10-6/K)the parameter ?mn? links the lattice energy and the LTEC of a binary crystal together, which can be obtained from the crystal structural data, Fmn? is the fraction of one type of chemical bond in the complex crystal.
