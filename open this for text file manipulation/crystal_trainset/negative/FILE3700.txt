Oliver and Pharr described the unloading process as the contact of a paraboloid of revolution on a half space, and proposed the following equation for the evaluation of hc:(3)hc=hmax??PmaxSmaxwhere hmax is the maximum penetration depth, Pmax the maximum indentation load, Smax the slope of the unloading curve at the maximum load, and ? is equal to 3/4.
