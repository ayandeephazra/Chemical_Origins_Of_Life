In an effort to predict the thermo-mechanical properties of fcc Ni-Mo solid solutions, the first-principles quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) was applied to describe the Helmholtz free energy F(V, T) as a function of volume V and temperature T [32],(1)F(V,T)=Esta(V)+Fele(V,T)+Fvib(V,T)in which E sta(V) is the static energy at 0 K, F ele(V, T) and F vib(V, T) are the contributions due to the thermal electronic excitation and the lattice vibration, which were estimated using the Fermi-Dirac distribution function [33] and the Debye model [34] respectively.
