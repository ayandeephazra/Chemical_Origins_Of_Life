In the present study, two twinnability measures are used to evaluate the twinning tendency of Ni-Mo solid solution at high temperature, which have been proved to be applicable in this system [30] with the expressions as follows [16,18]:(3)T=3?usf-2?isf/?utf (4)?d=?isf/?usf-?isf The twinnability measure T is derived within the Peierls framework involving the ISF, USF and UTF energies, while ?d is an improved measure simply depending on the first half of ?-surface.
