In particular, in our refinement we located (Table 4): (1) one independent site populated by K and Ba (i.e., K(1)) coordinated to 6 oxygen sites (belonging to the framework) and 4H2O molecules; (2) a further K-rich site with high positional disorder and therefore modeled as two sub-sites: K(2A) and K(2B) (with partial site occupancy and only 0.68(4)A? apart) coordinated to 2H2O molecules and 7?8 oxygen sites; (3) an additional K-site (i.e., K(3)) with very low site occupancy and coordinated to 6H2O molecules; (4) a further K-site (i.e., K(4)) with very low site occupancy and coordinated to 8 oxygen atoms (i.e., bridging O sites of the 8-membered ring channels running along the principal axes); (5) one Ca-site coordinated to 8H2O molecules (i.e., Ca(1)), (6) an additional Ca-site (i.e., Ca(2)), with partial site occupancy and coordinated to 3 oxygen sites and 4H2O molecules; (7) a further cationic site (modeled with the scattering curve of Ca) (i.e., Ca(3)) with a very low site occupancy and virtually coordinated by 5H2O molecules, lying in the 8-membered ring channels.
