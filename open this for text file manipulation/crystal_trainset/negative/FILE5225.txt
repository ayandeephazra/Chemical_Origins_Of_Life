The empirically determined linear trend derived for the Na bearing samples by [11] was represented by a linear regression with formula:(1)(1)V/V0=1.146(11)?0.00050(3)žV0(A?3) Based on the unit-cell volume of our sample (V 0 = 423.36 A?3), the equation (1) for NaMnSi2O6 sample would provide a V/V 0 compression to 10 GPa of 0.93272, whereas applying the equation of state coefficients obtained using our experimental data calculated V/V 0 corresponding to 10 GPa yields 0.93422.
