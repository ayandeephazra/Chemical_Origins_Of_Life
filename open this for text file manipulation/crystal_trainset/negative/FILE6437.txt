The measured frequency shifts ??i were used to calculate the corresponding velocities Vi of the acoustic modes using the relationship reported in Whitfield et al. (1976):(1)Vi=?vi?o2sin(??2)where ? 0 is the wavelength of the laser beam, ? ? the external scattering angle between the incident and the scattered light and Vi corresponds to the velocity of the compressional (V P) or the shear phonon (V S).
