Thus defined nanofilm thickness (measured from the middle of the slab) for hydrogenated and bare (111) nanofilms is around 3.18 A? which is in the ñ3 % range of ?nominal? value 3.07 A?T?his means that indeed the linear electron density in nanofilms is approximately the same, as in bulk diamond and that correlation between in-plane dimensions and ratio of elastic modulus for hydrogenated and reconstructed diamond nanofilms (i.e. Fig. 2) also holds for their ?nominal? biaxial moduli.
