This term is usually evaluated by Mermin statistics F el = E el ? TS el, where E el and S el are the internal energy and electronic entropy due to electron thermal excitation [31]:(3)Eel(V,T)=?n(?)f?d????Fn(?)?d? (4)Sel(V,T)=?kB?n(?)[flnf+(1?f)ln(1?f)]d?where n(?) is the electronic DOS, ? the eigenvalues, ? F the Fermi energy level, f the Fermi distribution function f?,T,V=1/exp???T,VkBT+1, k B is the Boltzmann?s constant, and ? the electronic chemical potential which should be carefully calculated to keep the number of electrons at T to be constant (the same as the number at 0 K and below ? F).
