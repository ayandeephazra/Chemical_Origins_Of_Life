Concerning the volume compressibility (? V), Anderson and Anderson [3] proposed a simple relationship between the bulk modulus at room pressure and temperature, K T0, (i.e. the inverse property of ? V) and the unit-cell volume at room conditions, V 0, proposing that for isostructural compounds K T0 ž V 0 = constant.
