As will be examined in more detail in Section 4.2, peak stress and ductility (i.e., ? at maximum P) are substantially larger for polycrystals with grain sizes on the order of tens of nm compared to those with sizes on the order of tens of microns, as is evident upon comparison of data in Figs. 4(g) and 5(e).
