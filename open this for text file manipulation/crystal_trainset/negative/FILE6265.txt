Thus, the shear modulus on the (h k l) shear plane with shear stress applied along [u v w] direction can be expressed as [40] (4)G-1=4s11(?12?22+?12?22)+4s33?12?22+8s12?1?2?1?2+s66(?1?2+?2?1)2+8s13(?1?2?1?2+?1?2?1?2)+s44[(?1?2+?2?1)2+(?1?2+?2?1)2]where ? 1, ? 1, ? 1, ? 2, ? 2, ? 2 are the direction cosines of the [u v w] and [H K L] directions in the coordinate systems.
