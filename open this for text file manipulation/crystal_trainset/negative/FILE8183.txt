The activation energy of an elementary mechanism can be taken into account by considering the Arrhenius? law where the chemical reaction rate is expressed as(71)ki=?žexp(-?EiRgTsensor)With ?Ei the activation energy of the mechanism i (in Jmol?1), R g the ideal gas constant (8.31Jmol?1 K?1) and T sensor the sensing layer temperature (in K), ? is the dynamic prefactor representing the attempt frequency of jump for the adsorbed species of desorption process [779].
