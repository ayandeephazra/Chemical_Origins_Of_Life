The stabilisation features can be further assessed using chemical bonding criteria based on the crystal orbital overlap populations (COOP) ?45? which consist of the expectation values from operators of the non diagonal elements of the overlap population matrix: c* ni k Sijcnj k=c* ni k<?ki r??kj r>cnj k where Sij represents an element of the overlap matrix of the basis functions and cnj (k) are the expansion coefficients entering the wave function of the nth band.
