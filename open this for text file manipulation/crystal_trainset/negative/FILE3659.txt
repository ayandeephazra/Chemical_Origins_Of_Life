In carbonophosphates framework, there exist vacant channel plus large [NaOn] (n = 6,7) polyhedron yielding major volume contraction, thus the [CO3] triangles bears little pressure effect because they share only one O atom with [NaO6] polyhedron [38]; whereas in calcite structure, the volume contraction is mostly realized by strong compression of [CaO6] octahedron, which would induce more coordination number of Ca2+.
