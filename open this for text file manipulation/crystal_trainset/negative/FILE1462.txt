To study the mechanical properties of the bulk Ni as modulus of elasticity (E), shear elasticity modulus (G) and constants of deformation (?) by using the z-axis deformation method with determine the relationship between stress, strain by the formula:(3?zz=lzz(t) - lzz(0)lzz(0)=??zz,with ?= 1E, ?zz=?zz-?(?xx+?yy), ???=1N?i=1N1Vi[miv?iv?i+12?i=?jFijrij,?rij,?rij],(4)G = E2(1 +?)and?=0.31 In it, E is the modulus of elasticity, G is shear elasticity modulus and ? is constants of deformation, ? is poison coefficient, ?zz is the deformation in zz axis; ?xx, ?yy, ?zz is the stress on the x, y, z-axis, and ??? is stress model.
