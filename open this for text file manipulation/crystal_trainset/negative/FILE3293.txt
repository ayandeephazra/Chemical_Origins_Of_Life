In this formalism, the isothermal bulk modulus, KT, is obtained as the second derivative of the Helmholtz free energy with respect to strain (f) and retains all terms that originate from the truncation to third order in strain of the free energy expansion:(9)KT=(1+2f)5/2ž[K0+(3KT0KT0??5K0)f+272(K0K0??4K0)f2]+(?+1?q)??ETH(V,T)V??2V[TCV(V,T)?T0CV(V,T0)] where(10)f=12[(V0V)2/3?1]=?? is the negative of the eulerian strain (?), V is the molar volume, T is temperature, KT0 and KT0? are the isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivative and the subscript zero indicates the reference state set at room conditions, q=(?ln???ln?V) and ? is the Gru?neisen parameter.
