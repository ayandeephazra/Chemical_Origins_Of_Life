For the tetragonal crystalline structure of mackinawite (FeS), the well-known Born criteria [42] must be satisfied for mechanical stability.(12)C11>0;C33>0;C44>0;C66>0;C11?C12>0;C11+C33?2C13>0;2C11+C12+C33+4C13>0 The calculated elastic constant of mackinawite (FeS), C 11 = C 22 (46.72GPa) is larger than C 33 (13.77GPa), suggesting that mackinawite (FeS) is unstable and that the distortion along the [001] direction is easier, which agrees its the layered structure.
