The first-principles methods employed in this work allow to obtain elastic constants (C ij), Young's modulus (E), shear modulus (G), Poisson's ratio (?) as well as thermal properties, i.e., Debye temperature (?), formation enthalpy (H), heat capacity (C v) and Helmholtz free energy (F) under different hydrostatic pressures (ranging from 0 to 30 GPa).
