At a pressure of 3.5 GPa, the compressibilities (?) of the bonds lying within the mirror plane (K ? F1(3) ? = 11.4 ž 10?3 GPa?1; K ? F1(1?) ? = 9.2 ž 10?3 GPa?1) are marginally higher than those lying out of the mirror plane (K ? F2(1) ? = 8.0 ž 10?3 GPa?1; K ? F2(7) ? = 7.9 ž 10?3 GPa?1; K ? F2(8) ? = 4.1 ž 10?3 GPa?1).
