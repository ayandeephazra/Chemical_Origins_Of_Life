The polarization anisotropy factor for VS (AS; also called as the shear-wave splitting factor) is the percentage difference in the velocity of the two shear waves propagation in a given direction, and is defined as:AS=(VS1?VS2)/VSž100%, where VS1 and VS2 are two orthogonally polarized VS velocities, and VS represents aggregate VS velocity.
