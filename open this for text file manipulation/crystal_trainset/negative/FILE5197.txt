A single crystal of natural namansilite, NaMnSi2O6, space group C2/c, was selected from the same sample identified by Lucchetti et al. [13], then studied by Basso et al. [14] (in this work the authors provide the following almost pure NaMnSi2O6 composition, in wt%: SiO2 = 51.32, Al2O3 = 0.16, TiO2 = 0.09, Fe2O3 = 0.18, Mn2O3 = 35.33, MgO = 0.02, CaO = 0.08, Na2O = 13.42, K2O = 0.02, which, if considered on the second digit, gives a formula: Na1.00Mn1.03Si1.97O6; their X-ray diffraction data concerning the unit-cell parameters at room pressure gave: a = 9.500(1) A?, b = 8.610(1) A?, c = 5.353(1) A?, ? = 105.06, V = 422.81 A?3).
