Regarding grain size effects, a trend often observed in polycrystals is increasing strength with decreasing size (e.g., Hall?Petch strength increasing with the inverse square root of the grain size), which has been observed in metallic and ceramic solids with grains ranging from hundreds of microns to tens of nanometers in scale [1?3].
