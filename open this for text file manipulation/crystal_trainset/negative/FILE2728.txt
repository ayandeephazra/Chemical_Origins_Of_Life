This method can characterize the intrinsic compressibility of U3Si2 through determination of its pressure-dependent structural variation that is not susceptible to its bulk sample properties, such as porosity, grain characteristics, impurity and sample shape, each of which can affect the elastic parameters measured by RUS [19,47].
