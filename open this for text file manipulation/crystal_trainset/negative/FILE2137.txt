The diffraction peaks of the samples with a high cooling rate (10Kmin?1) can be indexed to the cubic structure (PDF#46-0465 Li0.35La0.55TiO3) (Fig. 1a), while the diffraction peaks of the samples with a low cooling rate (3Kmin?1) can be indexed to the tetragonal structure (PDF#87-0935 Li0.33La0.557TiO3) (Fig. 1b).
