The contributions can be calculated by taking into considerations (1) the outermost atomic layer, which is the primary contributor of the surface energy, (2) the surface unit cell have four atoms from which to calculate the surface strain energy for a nanocrystal, (3) the surface layer atoms are in relaxation and reconstruction conditions [664,665].
