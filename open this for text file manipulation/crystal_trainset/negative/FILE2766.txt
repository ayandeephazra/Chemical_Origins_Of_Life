On the other hand, the bond interactions along the c-axis are more resistant to compression, as reflected by the relatively small changes in the projected distances of diagonal bonding interactions (U2 and other atoms) along the c-axis; these interatomic distances contract only by 4%?7% when pressure increases from 2 GPa to 30 GPa.
