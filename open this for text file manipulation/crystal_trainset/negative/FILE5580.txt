Residual indentation depths are 64nm for 150W, 67nm for 250W, and 68nm for 350W, although these depths can only be considered as qualitative data because the NanoVision© system uses the same blunt Berkovich tip for probing, which is less sensitive than a sharp probing tip used in a conventional AFM.
