We note that although the C2/c space group symmetry was unambiguously determined via neutron diffraction [9], numerous subsequent articles have continued to use older, although similar, structural models which can now be discarded, in particular the P63/m, P63/mmc or P63/mcm space groups which do not account for a number of low intensity low angle reflections observed via synchrotron XRD.
