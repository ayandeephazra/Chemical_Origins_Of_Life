In this light, we have investigated the compressional behavior of ettringite up to 4.2 GPa by means of in-situ single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction, using a diamond-anvil cell (DAC) and the mix methanol:ethanol (4:1) P-transmitting fluid, which allow a description of the structure deformation mechanisms at the atomic scale and the determination of the bulk elastic parameters of ettringite, based on hydrostatic conditions within the P-range investigated [11,12].
