According to the above discussions and the geometry optimizations for all phases, structural transitions of the rutile-type (P4 2 /mnm) under pressure is obtained in the following sequence (the transition pressure is mentioned in parentheses): ? CaCl2-type, Pnnm (12GPa)?R-PbO2-type, Pbcn (17GPa)?pyrite-type, Pa 3 ? (17GPa)?ZrO2-type orthorhombic phase I, Pbca (18GPa)?fluorite-type, Fm 3 ? m (24GPa)?cotunnite-type orthorhombic phase II, Pnam (33GPa).
