The two polarizations of the shear mode (V SH and V SV) were only observed simultaneously in some crystallographic orientations (Figs. S1b and S2) and they were iteratively adjusted for the rest of conditions to fast and slow modes following the velocity pattern observed at ambient conditions (Fig. S1) until the RMS was minimized during the refinement procedure (Table 1).
