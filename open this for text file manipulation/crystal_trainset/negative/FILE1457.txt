To study the structural state of bulk Ni, using molecular dynamics (MD) method with Sutton-Chen embedded potential, recirculating boundary conditions [13,48?53]:(1)Etot=?i=1N12?j=1,j=?iN?(rij)+F(?i), (2)F(?i)=??C?i=1N?i,?(rij)=?(arij)n,?i=?j=1,j=?iN?(rij),?(rij)=(arij)nwhere Etot is the total energy of the material; rij is the distance between atoms i, atoms j; ?(rij) is energy between atoms i, atoms j; F(?i) is the interaction force between atoms; a is the lattice size; ?i is the atom density of the material; ? is energy, and the constant is m, n, N, C.
