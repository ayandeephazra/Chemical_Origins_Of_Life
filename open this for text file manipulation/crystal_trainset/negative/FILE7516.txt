Surface stability is evaluated by surface energy, S ?, which is often defined as(37)S?=12A(Etot,surf-Etot,bulk+P?V-T?Q)where A is the surface area defined in the slab, Etot,surf is the total energy of a surface lab, and Etot,bulk is the total energy of the counterpart bulk, which consists of the same number of atoms.
