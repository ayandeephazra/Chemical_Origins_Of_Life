The direct transitions with a magnitude of about 8eV are found to occur from O (p)-states to Sn (s)-states where the corresponding energy bands are relatively parallel i.e. at the A-point and the M-point and near these points in the A?Z, A?M and M?? directions of the BZ the M-point and near these points in the A?Z, A?M and M?P directions of the BZ [225].
