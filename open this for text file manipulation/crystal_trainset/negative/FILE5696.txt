Reliable quantification of mechanical properties can be useful for selecting a processing method (i.e., granulation or direct compression) or appropriate excipients in order to improve a blend?s poor compressibility, as well as to elucidate defects such as capping or lamination (Amidon et al., 2009; Sun and Grant, 2001) or to avoid unacceptable product damage during the packing procedure and distribution.
