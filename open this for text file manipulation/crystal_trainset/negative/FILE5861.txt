Since at room temperature, our data are basically consistent with the Nestola et al. (2010) and Hilairet et al. (2006a) data within uncertainty (see Fig. 4) and Nestola et al. (2010) data shows less scattering than the other data because of angle dispersive X-ray diffraction using a single crystal, we used a K T0 of 62.9GPa (Nestola et al., 2010), in order to get the (dKT/dT)P and the thermal expansion of antigorite.
