In order to have a complete and detailed overview of the relative stability involved in the different stacking systems (AAA, ABA and ABC), the strongest bonding interactions found within the sheets of the AAA phase should be weighted with the interatomic potential (van der Waals) acting in between the different graphitic layers.
