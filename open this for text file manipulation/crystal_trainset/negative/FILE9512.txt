Hence, the calculated results reported by Kushwah and Shanker [4] with the following expression(10)VV0=1-[1-2(KT0?+1)KT0PTH]1/2KT0?+1+1,and obtained from the relation suggested by Kushwah et al. [7] in the following form,(11)VV0=1-1?0+1ln[1-?0(?0+1)(T-T0)],are all presented in Tables 2 and 3 for the sake of comparison.
