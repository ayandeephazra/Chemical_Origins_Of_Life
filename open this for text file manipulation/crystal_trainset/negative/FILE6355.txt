A comparison of the values of K s, G, V p, V s and their pressure derivatives calculated from our Brillouin measurements, with those from a recent ultrasonic study on polycrystalline samples by Li and Neuville (2010), shows that these two data sets are in agreement, especially for the pressure derivatives of bulk elastic properties (Fig. 1 and Table 2).
