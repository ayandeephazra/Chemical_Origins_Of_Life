In this light, the compressional behavior and the P-induced crystal?fluid interaction of a natural paulingite have been explored on the basis of in-situ single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, and in-situ single-crystal Raman spectroscopy with a diamond anvil cell and a series of different pressure-transmitting fluids.
