Recently, several expressions for the temperature dependence of thermal expansion of ionic solids have been developed: Shanker et al. [3,4] presented a formulation based on the power series expansion of lattice potential energy extending the method originally due to Born and Huang [1]; Pandey [5] developed an expression using the assumption that the coefficient of volume thermal expansion ? is a quadratic function of temperature; Singh and Chauhan [2] put forward a relation based on the modification of the expression given by Anderson [6] for linear variation of ? with temperature at higher temperatures; and Kushwah et al. [7] obtained a relation on the basis of the two assumptions that the product of the coefficient of volume thermal expansion ? and the isothermal bulk modulus KT is constant and the Chopelas?Boehler approximation, i.e., the isothermal Anderson?Gruneisen parameter varies linearly with temperature, holds.
