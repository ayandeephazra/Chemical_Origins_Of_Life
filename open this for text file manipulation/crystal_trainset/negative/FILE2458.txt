We observed a systematic expansion of the zero-pressure unit-cell volume with hydration at ambient conditions from Tables 3 and 4, which is in good agreement with many previous studies for other mantle minerals (e.g., Smyth et al., 2003; Smyth and Jacobsen, 2006; Holl et al., 2008; Ye et al., 2010, 2012).
