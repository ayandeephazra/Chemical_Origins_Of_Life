The volume v i ? (dg i/dP)T resulting from Eq. (3) is found to be:(4)vi=ci?dBdPT?1which can be rewritten as:(5)vi=giBdBdPT?1or(6)vigi=1BdBdPT?1 The entropy s i = ? (dg i/dT)T is found by differentiating Eq. (3) in respect to temperature and inserting it into the relation h i = g i + Ts i we finally get the enthalpy h i [20].
