The unit-cell parameters at room pressure measured on our sample (see Table 1 ) even if more than 20 years later with totally new technologies substantially confirm the data by [14] and those by [15] measured on a synthetic analogue pure NaMnSi2O6 (X-ray diffraction data from [15] this work give the following unit-cell parameters at room pressure gave: a = 9.513(1) A?, b = 8.621(1) A?, c = 5.354(1) A?, ? = 105.14, V = 423.9 A?3).
