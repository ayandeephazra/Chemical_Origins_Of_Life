Furthermore, if we assume that the defect migration volume v bv m for the bound cation vacancy motion is approximately equal [20] to that of the free cation vacancy motion we find(11)vbvmgbvm=5.2?6.5ž10?2GPa?1 According to the cB? model, see Eq. (6), the ratio vigi should be equal to 1BdBdPT?1 irrespective of the defect processes.
