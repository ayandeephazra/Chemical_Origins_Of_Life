The X-ray diffraction data confirm that the penetration of methanol, ethanol and H2O does not change the long-range order of the structure, thus the lattice properties are kept preserved within the P-range investigated, and the zeolite does not reveal a mechanically-induced structural collapse as commonly manifested by pressure-induced amorphization.
