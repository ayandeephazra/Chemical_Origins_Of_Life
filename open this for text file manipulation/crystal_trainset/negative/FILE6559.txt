Interestingly, the velocity contrasts between ShyB and its coexisting hydrous phases are only moderate: aluminum- and iron-bearing phase D (AlFe-phase D) display aggregate velocities about 1% lower than ShyB whereas the velocity contrast with hydrous iron-bearing ringwoodite (hy-Fe-Rw) is negligible (ñ0.4%).
