In particular, atomically thin van der Waals semiconductors [9?12], which can be prepared by exfoliation from parental bulk crystals [13?15], are at the center of the attention of the scientific community for their potential impact in flexible nanoelectronics [16], photodetection [17] and membrane technology [18].
