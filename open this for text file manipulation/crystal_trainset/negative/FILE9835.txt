Mechanical test with bulk samples may yield more information than with ribbons, e.g.: (1) The deformation instability of ribbons can be eliminated; (2) The serrated deformation behavior, which is a characteristic deformation behavior of amorphous phase, can be more pronounced by using compression test; and (3) Studies may be made on the variation of the fracture surface to the load axis due to the increase of the crystalline fractions and the variation of the fracture morphology thereof.
