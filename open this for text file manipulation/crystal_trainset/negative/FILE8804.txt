The inversion in zinc aluminate is known, by X-ray diffraction,24?26 to be small in contrast to e.g. magnesium aluminate.27 Moreover, in computer simulations the inversion of zinc and aluminium atoms is also found to be energetically unfavourable.28,29 Furthermore, NMR studies on the cation inversion in zinc aluminate, which is prepared via the solid-state synthesis route, confirm the virtual absence of inversion.30 However, inversion has been found to some extent in zinc aluminate synthesized using a sol-gel method with alkoxides depending on the temperature.14
