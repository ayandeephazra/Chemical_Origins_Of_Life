Furthermore, it is clear from Fig. 4 that the normalized pressure as a function of the Eulerian strain at 300K has a positive slope, which is consistent with a value of K?0 slightly larger than 4 (Angel, 2000) shows that the third-order BM-EoS is a reasonable description of the P-V data in this study (see Fig. 5 ).
