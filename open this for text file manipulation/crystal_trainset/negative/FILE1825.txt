Single crystal neutron diffraction in the cubic phase at temperatures of 673 K, and 973 K showed evidence for significant anharmonicity in the behaviour of the fluorine anions, but no indication for the occupation of interstitial sites; the high conductivity was thus attributed to a small population of highly mobile F? vacancies [9].
