At present zinc aluminate is used as a catalyst for the dehydration of saturated alcohols to olefins,1 methanol and higher alcohol synthesis,2,3 preparation of polymethylbenzenes,4 synthesis of styrenes from acetophenons,5 and double bond isomerisation of alkenes.6 Furthermore, zinc aluminate can also be used as a catalyst support, since it has a high thermal stability, low acidity and a hydrophobic behaviour.
