The room pressure value of the Debye temperature was calculated from the experimental sound velocities according to the equations from Robie and Edwards (1966):(14)?0=hk(3n4?V0)13[313(1VP03+2VS03)?13] where h is the Plank constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, n=160 is the number of atoms in the garnet unit cell, and VP0 and VS0 are the experimental longitudinal and transverse velocities at ambient conditions.
