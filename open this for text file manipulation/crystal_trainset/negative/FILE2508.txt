We also calculated the temperature derivative of the bulk modulus extracted from each isotherm, and obtained (?K 0/?T)P =?0.018ñ0.005GPaK?1 for hydrous pyrope, which is very consistent with the results from the whole set of P-V-T data available in this study ((?K 0/?T)P =?0.018ñ0.004GPaK?1) within their uncertainties.
