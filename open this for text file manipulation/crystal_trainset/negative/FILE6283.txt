More specifically, the hardness of crystals having different bond strengths is given by the following expressions:(5)H=(C/?)únú?i,j=1n(NijSij)1/ne-?fe, (6)fe=1-k?i=1keii/k?i=1kei2, (7)andSij=eiej/(ninjdij),where Nij is the number or multiplicity of the binary system, Sij is the strength of the individual bond between atoms i and j; the reference energy ei is defined as ei = Zi /ri , Zi is the number of valence electrons and ri is the radius of the sphere (centered at atom i) in which Zi electrons are contained; ni and nj are coordination numbers of atoms i and j, respectively; dij is the interatomic distance, k corresponds to the number of different atoms in the system.
