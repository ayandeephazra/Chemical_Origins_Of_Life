Based on the geochemical and petrological estimates on the carbon contents of the mantle-derived carbonated samples, the total carbon budget in the planet's mantle can be in the order of (0.8?12.5)ž1023 g of C, whereas the amount of carbon in the near-surface reservoirs, including the crust, oceans, and atmosphere is in the order of (8.4?10.2)ž1022 g of C (Hirschmann and Dasgupta, 2009; Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2010).
