It is reported that the acceptor levels caused by NO were found to be ultra deep in the band gap, with P, As and Sb all found to act primarily as donor dopants on the Sn site [269].DFT calculation by Scanlon et al. [247] to examine Sn-poor/O-rich conditions, which for instance, was consistent with the results obtained by Varley et al. [269] for N doped SnO2.It is revealed that Al, Ga and In act as deep acceptors in SnO2 [268].
