In addition to showing excellent agreement between calculated and experimental values for bulk and surface properties across many inorganic compounds such as mica, silicate, and aluminate, the Interface Force Field (IFF) and its variants have also accurately reproduced cleavage energy, bulk modulus, and lattice parameters for hydroxyapatite (Emami et al., 2014; Heinz et al., 2013; Heinz, 2016; Lin and Heinz, 2016; Lin, 2013).
