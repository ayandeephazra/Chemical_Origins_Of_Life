Following Ref. [13], the internal energy U per unit mass of an isotropic glass in the presence of internal strains created by elastic dipoles can be written down as a non-linear expansion in terms of the invariants of the internal strain tensor,(1)?0U=?0U0+12?I12+?I2+16?1I13+?2I1I2+43?3I3+124?1I14+12?2I12I2+43?3I1I3+12?4I22+...,where ? 0 is the density, U 0 is the internal energy per unit mass of the undeformed state, I 1 = ? ii, I 2 = ? ij ? ji and I 3 = ? ij ? jk ? ik are the algebraical invariants of the deformation tensor ? ij, ? and ? are the second-order Lame? elastic constants, ? 1, ? 2 and ? 3 are the third-order Lame? elastic constants, and ? 1, ? 2, ? 3 and ? 4 are the fourth-order Lame? elastic constants.
