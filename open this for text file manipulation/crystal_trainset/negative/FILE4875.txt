To further evaluate the effect of carbonate presence on the seismic velocity profiles of the Earth's upper mantle and to place constraints on the seismic detectability of the deep-mantle carbonate, we have also calculated the velocity profiles of eclogite and peridotite containing 5 wt.% CO2 in the form of magnesite (Fig. 9 ).
