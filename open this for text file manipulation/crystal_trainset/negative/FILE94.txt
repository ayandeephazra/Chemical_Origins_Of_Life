The molecular statics (MS) method (i.e. at 0 K temperature) (Maz?dziarz, Young, D?uzewski, Wejrzanowski, & Kurzyd?owski, 2010; Maz?dziarz, Young, & Jurczak, 2011; Tadmor & Miller, 2011) simulations were performed with the use of the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) (Plimpton, 1995).
