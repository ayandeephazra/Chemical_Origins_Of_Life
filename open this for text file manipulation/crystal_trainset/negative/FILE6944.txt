In geometrical structures, the one-dimensional nanostructures can be classified into three main groups [187]: (1) hollow nanotubes, (2) solid nanowires, (3) coaxial cable structures, (4) side-by-side biaxial nanowires, structured by stacking of two nanowires of different materials in parallel; and (5) nanobelts (or nanoribbons).
