Since the capacitors are not made of a fully dense polycrystalline material, the real part of the measured dielectric constants (k?meas) is related to the real part of the single crystal dielectric constant (k?) by:(5)k?=3??2?k?meas,where ? is the relative density.40 The results are shown in Table 2 .
