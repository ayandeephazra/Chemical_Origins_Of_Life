By differentiating Eq. (1) with respect to pressure and considering that the defect volume ? i is given by ? i =(dg i/dP)|T we find(2)?i=cidBdP|T?1?which, when combined with Eq. (1), leads to(3)?i=giBdBdP|T?1This relation interconnects ? i and g i through the bulk properties B and (dB/dP)|T that are involved in the equation of state.
