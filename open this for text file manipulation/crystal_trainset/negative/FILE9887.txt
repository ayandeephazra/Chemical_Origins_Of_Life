When the nanocrystals are separated by the amorphous matrix and the crystals are much smaller than the shear bands, the deformation of the shear bands is dominated by the amorphous matrix, but the nanocrystals act as barriers to the deformation of the shear bands, as a result, the fracture surface still shows vein pattern but the diameter of the veins is reduced (Fig. 9(a), (b) and (c)).
