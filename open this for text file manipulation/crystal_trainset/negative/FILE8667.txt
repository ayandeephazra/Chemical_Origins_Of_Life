E tot is the total static energy per atom of the solid given by(4)Etot=12?i,j(i=?j)V(Rij),The frequency vs. wave vector dispersion of the phonons in various symmetry directions for fcc Cu, Ag and Au at equilibrium lattice parameters are shown in Fig. 2 and compared with the room temperature inelastic neutron scattering data [14?17].
