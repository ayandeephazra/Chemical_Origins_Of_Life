The results discussed above suggest that the presence of ShyB in cold subducted slabs could contribute to the low velocity anomalies reported in Tonga, including the reduced velocity layer on top of the slab that extends down to 600km depth (Savage, 2012) or the negative velocity contrast of about 3% from the southern to northern region in the Tonga subduction zone (region II to region I in Brudzinski and Chen (2000, 2003)) at intermediate depths within the transition zone.
