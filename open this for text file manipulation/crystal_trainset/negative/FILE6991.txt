For this, the single-particle wave functions ?(r) of three-dimensional periodic bulk, two-dimensional periodic film (or, quantum well), one-dimensional periodic wires, or zero dimensional periodic dots are expanded by a handful of three-dimensional-periodic Bloch orbitals taken from the Brillouin zone center of the underlying bulk solid.
