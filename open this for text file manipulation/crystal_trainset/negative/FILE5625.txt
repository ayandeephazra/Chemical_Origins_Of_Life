These equations show that the changes of the internal energy and elastic moduli with respect to the reference crystal are conditioned by the averaged quadratic form of the dipole ?-tensor and concentration c of frozen-in elastic dipoles (if c =0, then ?U =0 and the elastic moduli are equal to those of the reference crystal), i.e. by the quantity c?ij?ji ?.
