The maximum and minimum edge of the band gap in the density of states, which is caused by valence and conduction band, respectively, are dominated by Pt(s), Pt(d) in the valence band, while the conduction band minimum has mainly contributions from the Pt(s), Pt(d) and O(p) orbitals for all three structures.
