From our geometry optimization calculations, we found that the maximum error of the calculated lattice constants of mackinawite (FeS) relative to the experimental and other theory results was 3.29% [15,16,47]; the calculated lattice constant of pyrite (FeS2) was 0.20% larger than that in other cited results [21,22,48].
