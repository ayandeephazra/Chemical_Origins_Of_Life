Bhise et al. [86] observed that the high emission current density, good current stability and mechanically robust nature of the In doped SnO2 nanowires offer unprecedented advantages as promising cold cathodes for many potential applications based on field emission, where the electron density lies between 1.3ž1020 and 13.2ž1020 cm?3.
