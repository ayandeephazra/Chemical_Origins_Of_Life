A lot of studies on the elastic properties of grossular have been determined by X-ray diffraction, ultrasonic interferometry, and Brillouin scattering spectroscopy (e.g., Bass, 1989; Conrad et al., 1999; Olijnyk et al., 1991; Pavese et al., 2001; Kono et al., 2010; Gre?aux et al., 2011), giving K 0 values from 166 to 172GPa.
