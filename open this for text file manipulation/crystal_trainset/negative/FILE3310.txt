The majoritic single-crystal elastic moduli can then be related to the aggregate moduli through the following equations:(3)C11=Ks+4/3G=?VP2 (4)C44=G=?VS2 (5)C12=Ks?2/3G=?(VP2?2VS2) assuming the equality:(6)2C44=C11?C12 The elastic properties and sound velocities of both samples as a function of density, pressure and temperature are summarized in Table 2 .
