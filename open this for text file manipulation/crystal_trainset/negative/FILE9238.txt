Fig. 6 is the relation of the load to the displacement tested by Nanoindenter on the microstructure of bulk glass Zr52.5Ni14.6Al10Cu17.9Ti5 alloy after annealing at different temperatures, by which the compressive strains decrease with changing the microstructure from glass state to crystalline and nanostructure, that implies that the deformation resistance and microhardness become larger for crystalline structure and nanostructure than glass structure.
