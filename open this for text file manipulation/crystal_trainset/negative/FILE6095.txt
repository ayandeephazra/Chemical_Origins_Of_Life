Experimental investigation of electrical resistivity [52] and electronic structure [53] has revealed that films that are thick enough (10nm or somewhat less depending on the substrate) show clearly pronounced metallic behavior that is typical for bulk LaNiO3 and can be properly represented at DFT level.
