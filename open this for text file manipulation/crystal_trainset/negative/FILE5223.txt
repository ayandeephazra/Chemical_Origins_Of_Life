Referring to the phases with a lower compression the linear relationship could be assigned to M2+M13+Si2O6 clinopyroxenes with Na at M2 site and trivalent cations at M1 site while the second trend corresponding to the pyroxenes with higher compression can be related to M22+M12+Si2O6 with Ca at M2 site and divalent cations at M1 site.
