Individual symmetry-related anion sites are labelled using the nomenclature of Knight [26], and the amplitudes of the seven symmetry-adapted basis-vectors of the cubic aristotype phase (d i) were calculated from the fractional coordinates and unit cell parameters at each pressure using standard methods [29].
