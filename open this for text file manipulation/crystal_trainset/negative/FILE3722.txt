Moreover, we have used the nonlocal van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method developed by Dion et al. [39] and its revised version with a modified interaction kernel by Lee et al. [40] (vdW-DF2) both paired with different exchange-correlation functionals, namely the C09 by Cooper [41], the consistent-exchange (CX) functional [42] and variations of the PW86 functional [43], such as the B86R [44] and OB86R [45].
