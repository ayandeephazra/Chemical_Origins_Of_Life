Alternatively, sub-adiabatic mantle temperature gradients and the accumulation of harzburgite-rich material supplied by slab stagnation at the bottom of the transition zone (Irifune et al., 2008) or a chemically distinct transition zone enriched in mafic material with depth (Anderson and Bass, 1986) have been proposed to explain the misfit, although consensus has not been reached.
