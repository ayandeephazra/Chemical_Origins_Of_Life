Theoretically, standard density functional theory (DFT) and DFT calculations with a correction for van der Waals interactions (DFT-D2 scheme of Grimme) have been used to simulate the bulk properties including electronic properties, vibrational frequencies and mechanical properties of stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric mackinawite (FeS) [11,26].
