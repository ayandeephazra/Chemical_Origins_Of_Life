The charge density distribution in the depletion zone can be determined by solving the one dimensional Poisson equation [217] (39)?(z)=e[p(z)-n(z)+D+(z)-A-(z)]=?r?0d2V/dz2where e is the elementary charge, p and n are the charge carrier densities, i.e. number of holes and electrons and D + and A ? are the densities of singly charged donors and acceptors and ?r is the dielectric constant of the material.
