Two compositions mainly containing the C phase (nominal x = 0.8 and 0.9) are considered too, with the primary aim to check the C/F amount ratio obtained at ambient and at high pressures; moreover, the composition of the F phase in the (F + C) biphasic sample Ce0.2Lu0.8O1.6, primarily found by x-ray diffraction [12], could be confirmed through the measurement of the bulk modulus.
