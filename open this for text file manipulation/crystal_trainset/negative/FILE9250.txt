The formation of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni compounds does not need long-term diffusion of Ni atoms which is proved by the radial distribution functions for Zr atom indicating that the atomic fraction of Ni in the nearest neighbors around Zr does not change after annealing at different temperatures [5,33], so that the nucleation and growth of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni compounds arise relative small changes in systematic energy and interfacial energy between glass phase and Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 or Zr2Ni phase.
