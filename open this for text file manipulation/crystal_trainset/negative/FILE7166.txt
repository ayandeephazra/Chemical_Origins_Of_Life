However, calculation based on the thermodynamic ionization energies of these defects within the screened hybrid density functional, HSE06, to investigate the interaction of group acceptors (for example, In, Al, Ga, Li, N) with hydrogen impurities in this system indicates that an efficient p-type SnO2 is not achievable.
