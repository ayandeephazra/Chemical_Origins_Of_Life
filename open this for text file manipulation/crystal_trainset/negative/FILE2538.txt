Second, in consideration of the very minimal effect of hydrogen on the thermal expansion coefficient at ambient conditions of pyrope (Table 4), we used the thermal expansion coefficient of dry pure pyrope (? 0 =(2.58ñ0.20)ž10?5 K?1, and ? 1 =(1.02ñ0.46)ž10?8 K?1) (Zou et al., 2012) to calculate the density profile of hydrous pyrope.
