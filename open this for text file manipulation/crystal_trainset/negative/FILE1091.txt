For their XRD experiments Daphne 7575 oil was used, which has a hydrostatic limit at ambient temperature of ~ 4 GPa, so it is not clear why the XRD peaks are so broad at low pressure, although it is possible that the sample chamber was too densely packed to allow room for sufficient PTM, therefore leading to bridging of the sample between diamonds.
