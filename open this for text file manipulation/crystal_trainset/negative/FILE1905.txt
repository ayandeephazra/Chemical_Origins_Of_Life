Within the CaF6 octahedron, all bond lengths are found to decrease with increasing pressure, and unlike the effect of temperature, where the thermal expansion coefficient of the BX bonds is much less than the AX bonds, the B-site bond compressibilities in KCaF3 are similar to those observed for the A site.
