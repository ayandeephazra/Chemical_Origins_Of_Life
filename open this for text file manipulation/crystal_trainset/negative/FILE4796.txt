As a result of the variable pressure?temperature (P?T) and oxygen fugacity conditions in the Earth's interior, deep-mantle carbon can exist in a number of forms including CO2-rich and hydrocarbon-rich fluids/melts, accessory minerals (carbonates, diamond, and graphite), iron carbides, among others (Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2010; Kaminsky and Wirth, 2011).
