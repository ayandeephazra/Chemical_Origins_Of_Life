It is generally proposed [842] that the NO2 sensing at low operating temperatures, where we have obtained the highest responses is due to NO2 chemisorption and to the consequent charge depletion of the sensing materials following the reaction:(75)NO2(g)+e-?NO2-(ads) Calculations by Epifani et al. [843] showed that surface reduction influences both the energy exchange and the charge transfer between surface and analyte.
