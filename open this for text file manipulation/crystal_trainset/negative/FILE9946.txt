The evolution of the microstructures of nanocrystals embedded in the residual amorphous matrix from the Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 amorphous alloy can be attributed to its following crystallization characteristics: (1) The crystallization occurs by steps; and (2) The residual amorphous phase (associated with the second crystallization peak) changes towards a higher crystallization temperature as the crystallization proceeds.
