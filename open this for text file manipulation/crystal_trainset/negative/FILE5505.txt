Furthermore, the defect structures for two Rh2+ centers {A} and {O} in LiD were theoretically studied very recently [7], by analyzing their experimental EPR parameters, based on the perturbation formulas of these parameters for a 4d7 ion with low spin (S =1/2) in tetragonally compressed octahedra and orthorhombically elongated octahedra.
