To overcome these disadvantages, Molecular dynamics method considered being an effective tool for theoretical method, include: Embodied-Atom-Method (EAM) [4?8] or Effective-Medium Theory (EMT) [9], Density Functional Theory (DFT) [10?12] to study the mechanical, Molecular Dynamics (MD) [13?20] to study the structure of material such as In 2017, author Dung Nguyen Trong and colleagues [13] has used embedding Sutton-Chen (SC) potential and determined success relationship between particle size (D) with atoms number (N) according to the relation D ~ N?1/3 and the total energy of the system (Etot) with atoms number (N) according to the relation Etot ~ N?1 for that when increases heating rate lead to the material moves from the liquid state to the amorphous state and the opposite is to the crystalline state.
