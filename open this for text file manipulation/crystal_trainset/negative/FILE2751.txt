However, even though the method for obtaining K 0 in this work is immune to deviations caused by sample preparation or bulk defects, its accuracy still depends on the confidence of the determined pressures, the (quasi-)hydrostaticity during compression or decompression, and the quality of the obtained high-pressure XRD data.
