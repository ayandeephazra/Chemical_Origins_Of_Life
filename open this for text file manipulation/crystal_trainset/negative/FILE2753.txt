Similar to the volume?pressure relation, variations of unit cell parameters with pressure can be fitted to the one-dimensional analog of the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state [39] (Fig. 4) by replacing V in equation (1) with a 3 or c 3:(2)P=3Ma,02[(a0a)7?(a0a)5],P=3Mc,02[(c0c)7?(c0c)5],where a0 and c0 are unit-cell parameters at zero pressure.
