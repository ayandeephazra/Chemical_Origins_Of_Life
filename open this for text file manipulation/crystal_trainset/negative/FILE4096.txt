The phase transition affects also the value of the monoclinic ? angle: as shown in Fig. 3, in the low-P form, ? progressively increases from 109.37 (1)ø at ambient pressure to 110.38 (4)ø at 4.01 (5) GPa; for the high-P polymorph, the ? value appears to be nearly unaffected by P with an average value of 103.1ø (ñ0.2ø) (Fig. 3, S2 SM).
