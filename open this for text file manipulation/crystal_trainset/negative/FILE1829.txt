However the extremes of pressure required for stabilization of the post-perovskite phase of MgSiO3 has led to significant research activity being expended on analogue fluoroperovskites phases in which the physical property under consideration, or the perovskite-post-perovskite transition, occurs at more easily accessible temperatures and/or pressures.
