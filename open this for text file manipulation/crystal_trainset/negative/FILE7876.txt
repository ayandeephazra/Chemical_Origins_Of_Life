However, the nanowire volume for surface diffusion of adatom in the lower temperature region for the catalyst enhanced or catalyst free nanowire growth is(50)?R2dL/dt=?TR2+?SRwhere dL/dt is the growth rate, L is the length of the nanowire, R is the radius and ?T and ?S are the time independent constants related to different contributions to the growth.
