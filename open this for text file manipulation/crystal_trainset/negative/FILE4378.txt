The applied pressure ranges between 1 and 7 GPa; this choice was operated relying on the evidence that a 1% compressive strain, which is for instance close to the one occurring in a 250 nm thick Gd-doped ceria film deposited on a MgO/SrTiO3 layer [26], roughly corresponds to the application of 5 GPa [27].
