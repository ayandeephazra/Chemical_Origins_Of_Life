Trace amounts of dissolved hydrogen defects in nominally anhydrous mantle phases influence the physical properties of mantle materials, such as rheology (e.g., Chen et al., 1998; Mei and Kohlstedt, 2000; Jung and Karato, 2001; Kavner, 2003; Karato, 2006), elasticity (e.g., Jacobsen, 2006), and electrical conductivity (e.g., Karato, 1990; Huang et al., 2005).
