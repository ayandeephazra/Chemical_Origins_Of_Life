In summary, based on experiments and theories, it is found that the thermodynamic driving force, the Gibbs free energy difference between two phases, is always responsible for the shape choice in the different growth stages such as nucleation, growth, and structural transition of nanostructures, implying that the thermodynamic driving force is one of the physical origins causing the interesting morphological transformation in the growth of various nanostructures.
