For this, the analysis of various parameters of metal oxides including the correlation between electro-physical (band gap, electroconductivity, type of conductivity, oxygen diffusion), thermodynamic surface, electronic, structural properties, catalytic activity are important for the choice of effective solid state sensor [778].
