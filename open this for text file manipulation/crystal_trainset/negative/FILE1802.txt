The response of minerals and rock to differential/non-hydrostatic as well as hydrostatic stress is always the focus in geophysics region, such that knowledge of the elastic constants is important for understanding lithospheric flexure, the onset of brittle failure, and the seismic rupture (Turcotte and Schuber, 1982; Aki and Richards, 1980).
