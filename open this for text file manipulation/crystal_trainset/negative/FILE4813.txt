Electron microprobe analyses of the starting sample revealed a homogeneous chemical composition of MgCO3 with less than 0.5 mol.% Mn and Fe in total, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements showed that the sample had a rhombohedral structure (space group: R3 ?c) with lattice parameters a=4.6431(ñ0.0049) A? and c=15.0353(ñ0.0074) A?, consistent with the lattice parameters of magnesite reported previously (Ross, 1997).
