The metallic material has a structural FCC (Ni, Cu, Al), BCC (Fe, W, Cr) has successfully identified mechanical through the z-axis deformation method as Macmillan, Kelley [26], Parinello [27] argue that: Deformation of material dependent at dimensional of deformation and intensity of the pressure as: R.
