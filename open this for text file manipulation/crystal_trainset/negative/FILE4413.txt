No compressibility anomalies can be detected, at variance with the behavior of nanometric Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9, which points at a negative pressure effect above 15 GPa [27]: it was attributed to the non-homogeneity of silicon oil acting as a PTM at pressures higher than 13 GPa [35], causing a loss of hydrostaticity.
