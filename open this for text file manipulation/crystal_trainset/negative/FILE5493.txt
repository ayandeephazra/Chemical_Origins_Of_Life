It is well known that at ambient conditions LiH and LiD have NaCl-type structure, but the question whether there is a phase transition from rock-salt (B1) to caesium chloride (B2) structures, as observed in all other alkali hydrides, is still under investigation along with the question on what is the pressure of the insulator-metal phase transition.
