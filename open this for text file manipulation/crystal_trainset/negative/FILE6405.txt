Among these phases, superhydrous phase B (hereafter ShyB, Mg10Si3H4O18, 5.8wt.% H2O) is the stable hydrous phase at the conditions of the transition zone (TZ) and uppermost lower mantle (ULM) and therefore, a potential water storage site in the slab at transition zone depth and likely in the vicinity of the slab (Fig. 1).
