This is unproblematic for closely packed structures but for loosely packed ones such as those of graphitic-type C3N4, overlap is kept to a minimum by introducing pseudo atoms with atomic number Z = 0 and no core states at appropriate sites within the crystal lattice; those will be referred to as empty spheres (ES) hereafter.
