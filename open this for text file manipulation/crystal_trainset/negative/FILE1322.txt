The inception of failure for Z-direction uniaxial tension is not accompanied by the fracture of any bond groups with X?Y planar character, i.e. Ca(II)?O(I), Ca(II)?O(II), Ca(II)?OH, and Ca(I)?O(III) bonds; instead it is marked by fracture of the Ca(I)?O(II) groups and both variants of the Ca(II)?O(III) group.
