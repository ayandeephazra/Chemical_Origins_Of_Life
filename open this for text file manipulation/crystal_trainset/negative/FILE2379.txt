Much effort has been made estimating the water storage capacity of nominally anhydrous mineral phases to determine factors controlling water incorporation into the structure (e.g., Rossman and Aines, 1991; Kohlstedt et al., 1996; Rossman, 1996; Lu and Keppler, 1997; Withers et al., 1998; Smyth et al., 2003, 2007; Skogby, 2006; Mookherjee and Karato, 2010; Tenner et al., 2012).
