More importantly, if the relative strengths of these bonds are also taken into account, where U?U would be the weakest and Si?Si bonds the strongest, since U?U bonds are metallic and Si?Si bonds are covalent, then the lack of Si?Si bond component in the c-axis direction is further consistent with the observed anisotropy, i.e., smaller compressibility along the a-axis than along the c-axis.
