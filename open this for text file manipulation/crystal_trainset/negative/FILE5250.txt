The diamond anvil cell (DAC) technique is used in this work to investigate the effect of pressure on the crystal structure of heavily doped nanocrystalline Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC20) to determine if structural transitions, which could significantly change transport properties, occur at high pressure (up to ~20GPa) and to determine the isothermal bulk modulus in comparison to pure CeO2.
