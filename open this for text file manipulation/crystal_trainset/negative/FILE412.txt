It can be compared to the bulk modulus, which under the same assumptions is equal to:(2)B=E3(1?2?) In density functional theory calculations, the sum of two biaxial moduli of layered structure in two directions can be conveniently obtained as 2V??/?V by full structure relaxation of volume V upon application of pressure (stress ?), while keeping the size of supercell fixed in the direction normal to layers.
