The lattice contribution to the specific heat at constant volume C V was obtained from the temperature derivative of the total internal energy(6)CVph(T)=kB?Ks(??s(K)2kBT)2ž1sinh2[??s(K)/2kBT].To this the electronic part of the specific heat was added(7)CV(T)=CVph(T)+CVel(T),with CVel(T) calculated from the well-known expression(8)CVel(T)=?23kB2N(EF)Twhere N(EF) is the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level E F.
