Beyond once more demonstration of the importance of non-hydrostaticity in study the Earth's interior, the present calculation finds the effect of non-hydrostaticity on the properties of quartz is quite complex, not only the degree, but equally important the orientation of differential stress in relevant to crystal lattice directions would remarkably affect its mechanical performance.
