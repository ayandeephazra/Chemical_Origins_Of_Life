Substituting Eq. (8) into (7) and taking into account that the constant C 0 may be written as C0=?0KT0V0 in terms of relation (6), we get the following expression for the temperature dependence of volume thermal expansion of alkali halides by integrating Eq. (7) over temperature at ambient pressure (P=0):(9)VV0=1-1?0ln[1-?0?0(T-T0)],where V 0 is the volume at the reference temperature T 0.
