Since an elastic dipole interacts with the external tensor stress, it can be characterized by a second-rank tensor ? ij with the components equal to the components of the deformation tensor per unit concentration c of elastic dipoles, ?ij=???ij0dVV?c, where ? ij 0 is the strain field created by unidirectional elastic dipoles [13,14].
