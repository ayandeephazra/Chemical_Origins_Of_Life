The magnitude of the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative are similar to the fluor-perovskites: TlCdF3 (47.1, 4.1) [34], KZnF3 (54.8, 11) [35] RbCaF3 (cubic 50.03, 4.2; tetragonal 49.1, 4.6) [24], but is significantly less than others: CsCdF3 (63.1, 3.7) [34], RbCdF3 (61.9, 3.7) [34], NaMgF3 (75.6, 4) [36] and KMgF3 (77.1, 4) [35].
