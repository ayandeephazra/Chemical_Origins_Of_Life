This implies that the M 2 phase is harder than the M 1 phase, i.e., the bulk modulus and the shear modulus of the M 2 phase are larger than that of the M 1 phase, which is compatible with our results (the small difference in B H among them may be caused by the numerical errors and can be neglected).
