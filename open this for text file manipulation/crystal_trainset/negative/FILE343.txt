Quantification of this difference in compressibility can be achieved by fitting the data to the following equations [38]:(1)P=3Ma,02a0a7?a0a5P=3Mc,02c0c7?c0c5where P is pressure, Ma,0 and Mc,0 are the axial linear moduli for the a- and c-axis, respectively, a and c are the unit-cell parameters measured at a given pressure (Table 1), and a0 and c0 are the unit-cell parameters at ambient pressure.
