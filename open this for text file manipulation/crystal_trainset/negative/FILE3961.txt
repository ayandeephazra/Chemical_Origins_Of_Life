The crystal structure of ettringite is significantly complex (Fig. 1 ): its principal building units consist of [Ca3[Al(OH)6]ú12H2O]-columns, running parallel to [001], in which Al(OH)6-octahedra alternate with triplets of Ca(OH)4(OH2)4-polyhedra, disposed around the 3-fold axis; these units are connected by sulphate groups via hydrogen bonds with H2O molecules.
