Finally, Yasuda's relationship between the ? J parameters, which describe the angular dependence of the interaction potential, and the atom-atom potential functions (dependent on the interatomic distances) has been verified by the evolution of the parameter ? 6, deduced from the librational bands, when pressure is applied.
