In an attempt to relate the size of the SnO2 nanocrystals to the onset of phase transformation Jiang et al. [157] reported a preliminary high-pressure study of SnO2 with average grain sizes of 8nm and about 10?m and found that for both SnO2 samples the onset pressure of the rutile-to-cubic phase transition is almost the same about 18GPa.
