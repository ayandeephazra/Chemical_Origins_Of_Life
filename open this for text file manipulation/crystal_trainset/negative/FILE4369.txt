In spite of the validity of the described scenario, it is well known that the maximum ionic conductivity values in bulk RE-doped ceria occur within the F range, i.e. at x significantly lower than the one corresponding to the F upper boundary [7,17], as a consequence of the formation of C-based nanodomains trapping vacancies at fixed positions, and therefore hindering their free motion.
