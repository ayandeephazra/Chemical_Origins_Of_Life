The reduction in bulk modulus of bcc iron due to the oxide particles appears to be in agreement with the reduction in bulk modulus and increase in lattice parameters of bcc iron with alloying elements Al, Si, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, and Rh [43] as well as with the reduction in bulk modulus of bcc iron with embedded A2B2O7 oxide particles [20].
