The following notation for computational samples of nanocrystalline hcp material subjected to the atomistic simulations is usedSIZE?Ng?SYSwhere SIZE is a relative size of sample (S ? small, M ? medium or L ? large) assessed by the number of unit cells in the sample, Ng - a number of orientations of crystal axes (here 16, 54, 125, 128 or 250 randomly selected orientations), while SYS denotes the geometry of grain distribution, i.e.: BCC or random, see Tables B.5?B.15 presented in Appendix B.
