Based on the relationship between transition pressure (P BT) and energy band gap (E g) at zero pressure for several semiconductors, Jamieson et al. [261] suggested PBT?V = E g/2, where P BT is the transition pressure, ?V is the change in the volume change per mole at P BT, and E g is the energy band gap of low-pressure phase at zero pressure.
