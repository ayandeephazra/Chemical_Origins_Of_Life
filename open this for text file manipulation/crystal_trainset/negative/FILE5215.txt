Monoclinic clinopyroxenes have space group C2/c with crystal chemical formula M2M1T2O6 with M2 being occupied by mono- or divalent large cations (usually Ca2+ and Na+, with some minor amount of Mg2+, Fe2+ or Mn2+), with di- or trivalent cations being located at the M1 site (Mg2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Al3+ and in rare cases with Mn2+, Mn3+, Cr3+, Ti3+, V3+, etc.), and with T = Si and Al (for details see [27,28]).
