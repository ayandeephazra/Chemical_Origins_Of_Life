For a more comprehensive estimate of VO2 elastic anisotropy, we adopt the anisotropy indexes of bulk modulus and shear modulus (A B and A G) proposed by Chung and Buessen [25], and the universal elastic anisotropy index A U developed by Ostioja-Starzewski [26] for crystal with any symmetry, to estimate the anisotropic characteristic of the system.
