Up to now, most of the pyrope studies have been limited to either high pressure and room temperature or ambient pressure and high temperature, however, there have been few studies that focus on the thermoelastic properties of pyrope (Bonczar and Graham, 1977; Wang et al., 1998; Sinogeikin and Bass, 2002a,b; Gwanmesia et al., 2006; Zou et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013; Du et al., 2015).
