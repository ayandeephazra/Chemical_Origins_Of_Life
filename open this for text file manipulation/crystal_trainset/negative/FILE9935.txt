The high thermostability of the residual amorphous phase (associated with the second crystallization peak) may be attributed to: (1) The crystallization temperature of this residual amorphous phase becomes higher relatively to the annealing temperature (673 K); and (2) The crystallization temperature shifts to higher temperature as the crystallization proceeds (Fig. 4).
