Cold geothermal paths (i.e., below 600øC at 6GPa) that are typically followed by fast converging slabs in the Pacific (Abers et al., 2006; Syracuse et al., 2010; Van Keken et al., 2011) provide the thermal conditions to stabilize DHMS phases in the core of the slab and the cold peridotitic mantle in the vicinity of the subducted crust (Fig. 1 ) (Kaneshima et al., 2012; Tonegawa et al., 2008).
