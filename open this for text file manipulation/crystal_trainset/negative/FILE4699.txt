Assuming that cact,x varies only slightly versus the composition, Eq.(10) leads to(11)gact,xgact,I=(1+x?)21+x??We now consider that the conductivity ?, for a single conduction process, is given [15,16] by(12)??exp(?gactkT)Assuming that the preexponential factor in Eq. (12) does not change markedly with composition, we observe that the variation of the conductivity with the composition is governed by the function (1+x?)2/(1+x??) appearing in Eq. (11).
