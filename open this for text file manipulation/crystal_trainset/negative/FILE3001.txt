We gained a better insight into the structural transformation of CuZr precipitates, the intrinsic properties of both B2 cubic (CsCl-type) CuZr and B19 (?-AuCd -type) CuZr structures under hydrostatic pressures up to 30 GPa, i.e., the stabilities, the anisotropic elastic and thermodynamic properties, were investigated by first principles calculations.
