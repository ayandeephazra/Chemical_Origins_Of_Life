According to the paper by Anderson and Nafe [38], in fact, an inverse correlation exists between the bulk modulus of a metal oxide and its mean atomic volume; in systems such as doped ceria, where the total number of atoms changes with composition, this evidence means that the emptying of the structure, which crucially contributes to the mean atomic volume, is a significant factor in the calculation of the bulk modulus.
