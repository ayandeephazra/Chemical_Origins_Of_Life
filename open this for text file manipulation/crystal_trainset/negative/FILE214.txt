The entropy for the defect formation process (s f) and the defect migration process (s m), as well as the volumes for the defect formation process (v f) and the defect migration process (v m) are given by [20]:(1)sf=?dgfdTPandsm=?dgmdTPvf=dgfdPTandvm=dgmdPT When both, i.e., the defect formation (f) and the defect migration (m) processes, are operating, an activation Gibbs energy g act is employed, the temperature and the pressure derivative of which lead to the introduction of an activation entropy s act and an activation volume v act, respectively, as follows:(2)sact=?dgactdTPandvact=dgactdPT When an aliovalent impurity attracts an adjacent bound (b) vacancy (v) or interstitial, the (re)orientation of the resulting electric dipoles is described with an activation energy g b act, associated with an activation volume v b m ?
