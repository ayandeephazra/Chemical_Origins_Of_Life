The minimum work required for creating a fluctuation ?? in a solid in the reversible way in the absence of shear stresses will look like [29].(4)?f=?FV=12?2f??2T(??)2=12KT(??)2,where f is the free Helmholtz energy of a unit volume, V is the isolated volume in which a fluctuation of volume deformation is examined.
