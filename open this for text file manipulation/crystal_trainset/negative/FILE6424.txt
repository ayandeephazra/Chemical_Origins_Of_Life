While the anomalies observed at shallow depth have been attributed to the presence of textured serpentine, DHMS phases could be potential sources for the anomalies at greater depth based on the thermal structure of the slabs (Iwamori, 2007; Kawakatsu and Watada, 2007; Tonegawa et al., 2008; Tsuji et al., 2008; Van Keken et al., 2011; Zhao and Ohtani, 2005).
