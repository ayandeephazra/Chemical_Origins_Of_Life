Extrapolation of the unit cell volume of the high temperature cubic phase (phase field for T > 560 K) to 300 K suggests the volume of the KF12 dodecahedron at this temperature would be ?70.27 A?3, slightly larger than that observed in orthorhombic KCaF3 (68.94 A?3) that was calculated taking into account the four non-bonded interactions.
