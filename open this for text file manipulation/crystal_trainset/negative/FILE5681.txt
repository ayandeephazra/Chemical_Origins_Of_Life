Taking the crystallization-induced dilatation of the glass under investigation as given above and assuming the characteristic relaxation volume ? i for a dumbbell interstitial equal to 1.55 (Ref. [12]) (the dipole concentration calculated with this ? i using Eq. (11) is about 3.7%) then with Eq. (11) one arrives at U d ?3.9eV, which is in general agreement with typical dumbbell interstitial formation energies in simple metals [25].
