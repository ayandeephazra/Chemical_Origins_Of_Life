This model directly relates the indentation modulus Er = M to the elastic constants Cij of an anisotropic material by a simple equation:(4)M=Er=1?f(Cij)where f(C ij ) is the first term of the Fourier series expansion of surface Green's function, which can be obtained from the elastic constants Cij (for a detailed description of the function f(C ij ), see Ref. [56]).
