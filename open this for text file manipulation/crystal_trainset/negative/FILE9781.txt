It has long been suggested [25?32] that the defect Gibbs energy g i , where the superscript i refers to the defect process under consideration, e.g. defect formation, defect migration, self-diffusion activation, is given by(1)gi=ciB?where B stands for the bulk modulus (=1/?), ? the mean volume per atom and c i is a dimensionless constant independent of temperature and pressure.
