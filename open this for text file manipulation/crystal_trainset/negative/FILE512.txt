On the other hand, the expression of thermal conductivity (?) which is equal to (? e + ? L) the electronic and lattice thermal conductivity, respectively, in fact, the (?) can be defined as;(3)?e=32kBe2?T,where k B is Boltzmanns constant, ? is the electrical conductivity, and T is kinetic energy of carriers, and the lattice thermal conductivity formula was expressed in this context as [33];(4)?L=1Z???C?v??v???,where Z,?, and ? are the number of unit cell, volume of unit cell, and phonon mode, respectively.
