Obviously, the calculated lattice parameter of the B2 CuZr structure (lattice constant a = 3.271 A?) agrees very well with the available experimental data (a = 3.267 A? [19]), and the calculated lattice constants of the B19 CuZr structure (lattice constant a = 4.535 A?, b = 3.430 A? and c = 4.533 A?) also agree very well with the available data (a = 4.620 A?, b = 3.249 A? and c = 4.621 [20])).
