The dielectric polarizability (? D) is, on a microscopic level, related to the experimentally determined dielectric constant by the Clausius?Mosotti equation:(6)?D=1b Vmk??1 k?+2 ,where b is defined as 4?/3, V m the molar volume in A?3 and k? is the real part of the complex dielectric constant, which is measured between 1 kHz and 10 MHz.41?43 The dielectric polarizability is in this range only composed of the ionic and electronic components, where the electronic component itself is related to the refractive index n by the Lorenz?Lorentz equation:44,45 (7)?e=1b Vmn2?1 n2+2.
