The relative phase stabilities of the B2 and B19 CuZr structures expressed through the deviation of the formation enthalpies (?H) have been calculated by employing the following relation:(1)?HCuZr=(Etotal?EbulkZr?EbulkCu)/2,where E total represents the total energy of a CuZr cell under different pressure, and E bulk Zr and E bulk Cu are the energy of a Zr atom and a Cu atom in the bulk state, respectively.
