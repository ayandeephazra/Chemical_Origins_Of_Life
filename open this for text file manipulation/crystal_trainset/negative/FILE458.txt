Returning from the nanofilms to the nanodiamonds, the above considerations (based on the data taking into account only the surface reconstruction effects and ignoring effects caused by edges/corners reconstruction and electron confinement) suggests, that overall contraction of diamond nanoparticles is possible, only if reconstructed (111) face is present in their habit.
