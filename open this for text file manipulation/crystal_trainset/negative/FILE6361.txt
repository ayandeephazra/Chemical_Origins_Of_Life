Improvements in the preparation of polycrystalline samples for high P?T ultrasonics experiments, particularly the sintering of samples with near theoretical density and with higher-quality microstructure, have resulted in a convergence of values for elastic properties of pyrope-majorite solid solutions (e.g., Gwanmesia et al., 2009).
