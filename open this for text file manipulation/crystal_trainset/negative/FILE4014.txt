In this light, a decrease of 0.20 A? of the Odonor?Oacceptor distance (i.e., as revealed by the structure refinements) is pronounced and may lead to a dramatic change of the bonding configuration, ultimately resulting in weakening of the structure itself, which is consistent with the elastic softening observed by the P-V plot (Fig. 2, Table 4).
