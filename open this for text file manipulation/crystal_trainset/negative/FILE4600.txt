The bulk moduli B(mn)? of a certain type of binary crystals, on the other side, have a linear relationship with the lattice energy densities u(mn)? [34?36],(12)B(mn)?=??+u(mn)??(mn)?here ?? is a constant, the proportion factor ?(mn)? depends on the chemical valence ZA and the coordination number NC (A) of the cation.
