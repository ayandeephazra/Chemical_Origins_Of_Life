Unit-cell parameters were measured by in situ HP SC-XRD between 0.0001 (crystal in the DAC with no pressure medium) and 4.3(1)GPa (Tables 3 and 4 ), using a list of 36 Bragg peaks centered with a KUMA KM4 point-detector diffractometer, operating at 50kV and 40mA, with Mo-K? radiation (graphite monochromator).
