Here we showed that the activation energy that governs the temperature dependence of the conductivity in four out of five multiphased binary and ternary mixed crystals varies linearly with B? using experimental data alone, i.e. the inverse of the compressibility measured in Ref. [23] and the density values determined in Ref. [20].
