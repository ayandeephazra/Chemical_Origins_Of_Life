In the vdW-DF method, the exchange-correlation (XC) energy is given as(1)EXC=EXGGA+ECLDA+ECnl,where EXGGA is the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the exchange energy, ECLDA is the local density approximation (LDA) to the correlation energy, and ECnl is the nonlocal electron correlation energy.
