Calcite and dolomite carbonates (CaCO3 and (Ca,Mg)CO3), however, are stable only at P?T conditions at shallower parts of the upper mantle, e.g., at depth above ?120 km (?4 GPa); though, recent studies have suggested that these minerals can remain stable at higher P?T conditions within the Earth (Oganov et al., 2006; Mao et al., 2011).
