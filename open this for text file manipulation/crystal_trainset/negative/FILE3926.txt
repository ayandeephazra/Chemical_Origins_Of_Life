Employing the axial nearest neighbor Ising (ANNI) model [63] and the Debye model [34], the higher Debye temperatures (?D) of fcc Ni and Ni-Mo than those with hcp structures (Supplementary data Table S4) verify the further drops of their ISF energies at high temperature due to lattice vibration (Supplementary data Table S5).
