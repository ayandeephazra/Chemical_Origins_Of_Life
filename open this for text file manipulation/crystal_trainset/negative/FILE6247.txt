The six stiffness constants are normalized to the corresponding quantities for isotropy, i.e. C 11 and C 33 to ? +2G, C 12 and C 13 to ?, C 44 and C 66 to G, where ? and G are the Lame constant and Shear modulus obtained by the Hill average, and the companion constants are plotted along the same axis in the opposite direction.
