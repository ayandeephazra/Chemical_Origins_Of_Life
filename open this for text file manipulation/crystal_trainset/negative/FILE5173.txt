From average stress?strain behavior reported in Fig. 5(e), the following trends are apparent: initial tangent elastic modulus and peak strength increase with increasing R?, ductility does not necessarily increase with increasing R?, and peak strength decreases as grain boundary surface energy is reduced and cleavage anisotropy is eliminated (R?=0.1 and ?=0).
