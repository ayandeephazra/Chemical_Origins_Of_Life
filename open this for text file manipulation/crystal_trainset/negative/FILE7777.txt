In order to achieve the desired control and shape, the kinetic energy of the ad atoms, the flow rate of the carrier gas [442], the gas scattering during transport of the evaporant, the augmented energy applied to the nanostructures during growth, the thickness of the metal coating and the source-to-substrate are set as parameters of choice [443,444].
