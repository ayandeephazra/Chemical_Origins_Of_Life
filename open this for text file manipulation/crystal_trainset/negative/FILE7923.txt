It was mentioned in the previous section that (a) the shape formation in the one dimensional SnO2 nanostructure growth is size dependent, (b) the optimal size of nanobelts is two times larger than that of nanowires and (c) the ratios of wires and belts in the total synthesized nanostructures are 63% and 37%, respectively [413].
