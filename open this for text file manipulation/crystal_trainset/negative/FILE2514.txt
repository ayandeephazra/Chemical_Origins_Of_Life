Therefore, we assume that (?KT /?T)V =0 so the thermal pressures in Eq. (5) are independent of volume, an approximation that has been derived or assumed in many previous studies for mantle phases (e.g., Guyot et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1996, 1998; Anderson, 1999; Shim et al., 2000; Nishihara et al., 2004; Liu and Li, 2006; Liu et al., 2008; Fan et al., 2015).
