A prominent example is given by Brillouin studies of MgSiO3 perovskite (Murakami et al., 2007, 2012) which yielded significantly lower values (by up to ?20%) of the pressure derivative of the shear modulus, G? than obtained in ultrasonics experiments on the same or similar composition phases (Sinelnikov et al., 1998; Li and Zhang, 2005; Jackson, 2012).
