Results reported elsewhere in this paper have been obtained using ?=10-2, which produced the most numerically stable response; in such simulations, fully failed regions with ??1 have residual shear stiffness ??0.01?0, which can be interpreted as very weakly elastic as opposed to pure free space with absolute zero stiffness.
