The continuous change in composition of majoritic garnet with depth was taken into account in our calculations by the implementation of two different majoritic garnet compositions, TZ-garnet and ULM-garnet (see Table 3 ), referring to the compositions found by Litasov and Ohtani (2003) at 1000øC and 22GPa and at 1000øC and 25GPa, respectively.
