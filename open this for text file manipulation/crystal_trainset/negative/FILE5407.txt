The background curve was manually pre-defined and subsequently refined with the equation: B(2?)= a ž B 0(2?)ž[(1+ c)ž2?+ d]+ b, with B(2?) corresponding to refined background at position 2? and B 0(2?) corresponding to pre-defined value of background at the same angular position, and a, b, c, d as refinable parameters.
