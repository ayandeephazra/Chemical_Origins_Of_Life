The decomposition of the crystal formula into sub-formulas can be achieved by the following equations:(1)Aa11Aa22?AaiiBb11Bb22?Bbjj=?i,jAmiiBnjj=??(AmBn)? (2)mi=NC(Bj-Ai)žaiNC(Ai),nj=NC(Ai-Bj)žbjNC(Bj) NC(Bj-Ai) is the number of Bj ions in the coordination sphere of an Ai ion, and NC(Ai) is the nearest coordination number of the Ai ion.
