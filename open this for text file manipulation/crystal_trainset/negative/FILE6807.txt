This equation relates the observed lattice contraction of a spherical cluster to the surface tension through the concept of surface pressure [172] (6)Ps=2?(r)r=?aa3B0This equation though valid for a completely homogeneous, spherical system with no surface structure, still it has been applied to non-crystalline solid and also for calculating surface energy for wurtzite phase [166].
