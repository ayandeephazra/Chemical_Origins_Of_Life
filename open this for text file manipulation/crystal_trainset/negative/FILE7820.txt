Thermodynamically, the minimum radius of a stable liquid droplet under a certain degree of supersaturation is given by [459,460] (41)rm=2S?LVVLRNTln?where S?LV is the liquid?vapor interface energy, VL is the liquid molar volume, R N is the gas constant, T is the temperature and ? =(p ? p 0)/p 0 is the degree of supersaturation (here p and p 0 are respectively the actual ambient vapor pressure and the thermal equilibrium vapor pressure of the solid).
