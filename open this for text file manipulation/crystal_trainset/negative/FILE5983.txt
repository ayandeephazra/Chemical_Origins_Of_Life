A P-induced ordering of the H2O sites was described at 1.6?1.9GPa in a ?overhydrated? gismondine compressed in a penetrating P-transmitting medium (i.e. methanol+ethanol+water) [29], whereas a disordering of the H2O population was described at 1.6GPa in the P-induced ?overhydrated? K-(Ga,Si)-GIS synthetic compound [33].
