A number of experimental and theoretical elasticity studies on olivine polymorphs, including their hydrous counterparts, and majoritic garnets have shown that the pressure derivatives of their elastic moduli are significantly lower than required to produce such gradients (e.g. Sinogeikin and Bass, 2002; Jacobsen and Smyth, 2006; Irifune et al., 2008; and references in Supplementary Table 1).
