These changes will determine the amount CaSiO3 perovskite (CaPv) exsolved at depth (Saikia et al., 2008), a process that will contribute to increase the seismic gradients at the base of the transition zone due to the significantly larger shear velocities of CaPv compared to majoritic garnets (Irifune et al., 2008; Li et al., 2006; Kudo et al., 2012; Pamato et al., 2016; Gre?aux et al., 2019).
