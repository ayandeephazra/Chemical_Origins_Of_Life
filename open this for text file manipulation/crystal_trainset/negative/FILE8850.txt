Applying this additivity rule to zinc aluminate leads to a predicted dielectric polarizability of 11.76 A?3 (ZnO: ? D=4.13 A?3 Al2O3: ? D=7.63 A?3).48 The measured value of 12.06 A?3 differs 2.5% from the predicted values, which is larger than the typical values of 0.5?1.0% for other aluminates, beryllates, borates, gallates, silicates and phosphates (references in Ref. 48), but can be explained by the large experimental error.
