The phonon spectra were calculated by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix, obtained from the Fourier transform of the force constant tensor ?ij(l,m) given by(3)?ij(l,m)=?2Etot?Ri(l)?Rj(m),where i,j are the labels of the atoms and l,m refer to Cartesian components of the position vectors of these atoms.
