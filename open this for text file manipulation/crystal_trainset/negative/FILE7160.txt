The result indicated that the N?Sn?O structure is formed in the N-incorporated SnO2 [283].DFT calculations based on projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential, where PBE parametrization [275] of the GGA was adopted for the exchange?correlation potential, showed that the spin density in N-doped SnO2 is localized mainly on the N atom.
