The unit cell volume?pressure relation can be fitted by the second order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state [65]:(1)P=3K02[(V0V)73?(V0V)53]{1+34(K0'?4)[(V0V)23?1]}where V 0 is the zero-pressure cell volume, V is the cell volume at a given pressure P, K 0 is bulk modulus, and K0' is the pressure derivative of K 0, which is fixed at 4 [65].
