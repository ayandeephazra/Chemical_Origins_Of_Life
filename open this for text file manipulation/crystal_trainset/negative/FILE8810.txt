The dielectric properties were determined on a HP 4284A LCR meter and the elastic properties with a Panametrics model 25DL, using the pulse?echo method.23 The thermophysical properties as diffusivity and heat capacity were determined on a Compotherm XP/20X and on a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) of Perkin-Elmer model Pyris 1, respectively.
