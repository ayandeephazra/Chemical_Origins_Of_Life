The data for ~35nm SDC20 presented in this work extends the previous data interpretation of 4.7nm, 5.2nm and 12nm CeO2 data presented by Wang et al. The relative d-spacing (d/d0) data reveals the change in packing density of specific planes in the SDC structure, (111), (200), (220), and (311) as a function of pressure.
