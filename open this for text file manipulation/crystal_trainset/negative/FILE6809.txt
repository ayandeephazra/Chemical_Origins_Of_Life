Given that the condition for a phase transition to occur is ?lp=?hp, the necessary condition for a phase transition in a nanocrystals system (PnT) is given by(7)PnT(Vlp-Vhp)+Ulp(PnT)-Uhp(PnT)=?hpAhp-?lpAlpThe final term of the above equation depends only upon the nanocrystal surface area and the surface tension.
