However, in Fig. 8 we present the pressure-dependence of the two primary order parameters, the anti-phase tilt (proportional to the amplitude of the basis vector d 3 that transforms as the irreducible representation R4+), and the in-phase tilt (proportional to the amplitude of the basis vector d 4 that transforms as the irreducible representation M3+).
