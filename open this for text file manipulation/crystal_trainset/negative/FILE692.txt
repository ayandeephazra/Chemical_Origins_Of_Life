In this work, we aimed to develop a DC tablet formulation of CEL by simultaneously improving the flow, bulk density, and mechanical properties of CEL using a pharmaceutically accepted dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Scheme 1) solvate of CEL (CEL-DMSO) for the following reasons: 1) DMSO is an ICH class 3 solvent with an exposure limit of 50 mg/day (ICH, 2016), which is higher than the expected DMSO intake of 34 mg/day along with 200 mg of CEL; 2) CEL-DMSO crystalizes in block shape, which is expected to exhibit better flowability, higher bulk powder density, and easier die filling than the needle shaped CEL; 3) DMSO, being a polar solvent commonly used to dissolve hydrophobic drugs, may improve the dissolution rate of CEL; and 4) good physical stability of CEL-DMSO.
