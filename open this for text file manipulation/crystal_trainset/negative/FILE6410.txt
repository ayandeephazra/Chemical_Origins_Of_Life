Hydrous phases generally display lower seismic velocities and are rheologically weaker than their anhydrous counterparts (Jacobsen, 2006; Mainprice and Ildefonse, 2009; Mao et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014), hence they may significantly modify the seismic signatures of subducting slabs due to the formation of strong anisotropic microstructures resulting from the accommodation of much of the deformation in the slab (Faccenda, 2014; Faccenda et al., 2008; Jung and Karato, 2001).
