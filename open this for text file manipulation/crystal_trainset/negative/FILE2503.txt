The high temperature third order BM-EoS was applied to our high pressure and high temperature data in the following form:(2)P=(3/2)KT0[(VT0/V)7/3-(VT0/V)5/3]ž{1+(3/4)(KT0?-4)[(VT0/V)2/3-1]} In this equation, the thermal dependences of the zero-pressure volume (VT 0) and the bulk modulus (KT 0) at different temperatures are expressed using the following equations:(3)VT0=V0exp?300T?TdT (4)KT0=K0+(?K0/?T)Pž(T-300)where ?T is the thermal expansion at ambient pressure and (?K 0/?T)P is the temperature derivative of K 0 at ambient pressure.
