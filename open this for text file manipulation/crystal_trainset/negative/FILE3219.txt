Garnets constitute approximately 40% by volume of ultramafic compositions and 70% of mafic compositions (Anderson and Bass, 1986; Irifune and Ringwood, 1987a; Ita and Stixrude, 1992), but garnets formed from mafic assemblages will have greater Gr and Alm contents and in the transition zone less Mj compared to ultramafic assemblages.
