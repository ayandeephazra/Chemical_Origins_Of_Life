Parameters at the crystal level such as slip planes, thermodynamic properties (e.g., heat of fusion), and molecular packaging (e.g., true density) have been correlated with the compressibility and compactibility of pharmaceutical powders (Feng and Grant, 2006; Joiris et al., 1998; Khomane et al., 2012, 2013; Payne et al., 1996; Roberts et al., 1995; Roberts and Rowe, 1996; Sheth and Grant, 2005; Summers et al., 1977; Sun, 2008; Sun and Grant, 2001).
