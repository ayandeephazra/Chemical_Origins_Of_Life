Consequently a series of different combinations of C, B and N can be investigated for the search of new hard compounds, provided that the following simple condition is respected: pZV B+mZV C+lZV N=4nThe values p, m, l and n are integers and Z V(B), Z V(C) and Z V(N) are the electron counts of the atomic valence states (2s and 2p) for boron, carbon and nitrogen respectively.
