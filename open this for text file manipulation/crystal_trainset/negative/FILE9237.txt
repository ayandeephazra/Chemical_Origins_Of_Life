Related the XRD patterns to their microstructures, it can be found that the formation of Zr2Ni accompanies the formation of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds by phase separation, which leads to the formation of nanostructure composed of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 phases with a size less than 100 nm distributed on the matrix of Zr2Ni shown in Fig. 5 .
