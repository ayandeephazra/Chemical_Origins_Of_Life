The adiabatic bulk modulus and shear modulus and their pressure derivatives were obtained by fitting the aggregate velocity?pressure data to a 3rd order finite strain equation of state (Dziewonski et al., 1975) with the zero-pressure elastic moduli fixed to their values at ambient conditions (K S =150(2)GPa and ? =99(1)GPa) (Fig. 5 ).
