The elastic properties of a phase consisting of a solid solution of n end-members in a single mineral phase can be derived through a weighted summation of the individual elastic properties of the corresponding end-members:(15)?ss=1?i=1n1miVi?i=1nmiVi?i where ?ss is the bulk elastic property of interest, ?i is the elastic property of component i and Vi and mi are the volume and mole fraction of component i.
