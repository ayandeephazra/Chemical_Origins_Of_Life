This can be demonstrated by consideration of Fig. 11 b in which the dashed line shows the poor fit to the isochoric heat capacity of KCaF3 to a Debye model (363(7) K) (Note, the isochoric heat capacity was calculated from the experimentally determined isobaric heat capacity [27] using a standard thermodynamic transformation, in which we have further assumed that the bulk modulus is independent of temperature).
