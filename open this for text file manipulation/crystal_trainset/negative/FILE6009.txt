A comparison with the elastic behavior of the GIS framework-type materials shows that gobbinsite is significantly more compressible than gismondine [28,29] (KV 0 =63.8(2)GPa in silicon oil) and less compressible than K-(Al,Ge)-GIS synthetic analogue (KV 0 =31(1)GPa) [34] and K-(Ga,Si)-GIS (KV 0 =69(1)GPa at P <1GPa, 41(2)GPa at P >1GPa) [33].
