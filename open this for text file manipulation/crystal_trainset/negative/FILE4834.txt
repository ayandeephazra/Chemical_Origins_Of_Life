Since the VP and VS are intrinsically a function of crystallographic direction and deriving the full elastic constants requires the knowledge of the sample's density, we have followed a nonlinear inversion procedure proposed previously to solve the six elastic constants of the rhombohedral magnesite using the Christoffel's equations with initial densities from an equation of state (EoS) of magnesite (Every, 1980; Chen et al., 2001; Litasov et al., 2008; Sanchez-Valle et al., 2011).
