Similar to C element, BN can form many polymorphs, such as hexagonal BN (h-BN) [1], zinc blende BN (c-BN) [2], wurtzite BN (w-BN) [3], BN fullerene [4], BN nanotubes [5], 5H-BN [6], and amorphous BN [7], which will lead to the large diversity in mechanical properties for its multiplied atomic bonding.
