Our modeled results along a normally expected geotherm (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981; Brown and Shankland, 1981) show that addition of 5 wt.% CO2 decreases the VP and VS by less than 1%, while the change is less than 0.5% along an expected geotherm for a cold subducted slab (Peacock, 2003) (Fig. 9).
