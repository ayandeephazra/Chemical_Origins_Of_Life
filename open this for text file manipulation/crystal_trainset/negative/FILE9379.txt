These were obtained by fitting the velocity data for all platelets of a given composition simultaneously using Christoffel's equation (Every, 1980):3det|Cijklnjnl???2?ik|=0 where, ? is the density, ? is the phonon velocity, ni are the direction cosines of the phonon propagation direction, and the Cijkl are the elastic constants in full suffix notation.
