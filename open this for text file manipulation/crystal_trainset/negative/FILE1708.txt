To accomplish this, the evolution and nucleation of dislocations and stacking faults was studied using the centrosymmetry parameter (CSP) [33] which is defined as:(4)ci=?j=1N/2(Rj+Rj+N/2)2where N is the number of nearest neighbour atoms (12 for FCC structures) and R is the vector from the atom cito a pair of opposite nearest neighbours.
