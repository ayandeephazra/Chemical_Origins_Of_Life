The starting point of our quasiharmonic calculation of thermodynamical properties was the Helmholtz free energy of the crystal, which for a volume V or lattice constant a and at temperature T is given by(5)F(a,T)=Etot(a)+kBT?Ksln{2sinh??s(K,a)2kBT},where E tot is the static total energy given by Eq. (4) at a given volume V or lattice constant a.
