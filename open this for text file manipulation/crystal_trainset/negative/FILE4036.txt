Such an effect leads to a pronounced change of the H-bonding configuration (?densification of the hydrogen bond network?, as defined by Manzano et al. [9]) but, contrarily to the compressional behavior modeled by Manzano et al. [9], the final result is a significant softening of the structure, as our P-V data evolution shows.
