The bulk modulus K T0 and (KT0? were fixed to the value reported by Nestola et al. (2010) during fitting because our data are basically consistent with the Nestola et al. (2010) and Hilairet et al. (2006a) data within uncertainty at room temperature, and the Nestola et al. (2010) data shows less scattering than the other data because of the use of angle dispersive X-ray diffraction using a single crystal.
