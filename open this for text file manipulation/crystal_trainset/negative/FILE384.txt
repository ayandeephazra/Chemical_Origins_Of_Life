This effect is reliably observed in experiments on nanodiamonds with size less than 2 nm [5,6] and depends not only on crystal size (it decreases with the increase of nanodiamond? size), but is strongly influenced by morphology of nanocrystals, and can even change sign, if particular kind of face is present in the nanocrystal habit.
