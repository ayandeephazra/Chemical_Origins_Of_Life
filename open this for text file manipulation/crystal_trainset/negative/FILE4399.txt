The amount of C increases with increasing x, until this phase becomes the most abundant one at x = 0.6, and the only one from x = 0.9. At x = 0.8, for instance, the sample is formed by the mixture (88 mol% C + 12 mol% F); this evidence suggests the occurrence of out-of-equilibrium conditions, most probably due to a kinetic effect taking place during the oxalate coprecipitation stage, as elucidated in [12].
