According to Helmholtz energy, see Eqs. (1)?(6), we can predict thermodynamic properties, such as entropy, enthalpy and heat capacity at constant volume/pressure (Cv/Cp ) via the following equations:(7)SV,T=??G/?Tv (8)H(V,T)=G(V,T)+TS(V,T) (9)CvT=T?S/?Tv (10)CpT=CvT+?2V,TBTTVTwhere ? the volume thermal expansion coefficient, B(T) the isothermal bulk modulus, and V(T) the corresponding volume at temperature T.
