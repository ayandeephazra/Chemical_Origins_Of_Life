The aggregate velocities were fitted to third-order finite-strain equations of state (Davies and Dziewonski, 1975), yielding best-fit values of the aggregate elastic moduli and their pressure derivatives of: KS? =4.8(2), G?=1.7(1) with ? 0 =3.264(6)g/cm3, Ks =114.6(7)GPa and G =72.7(4)GPa (Table 2 ) (where primes indicate the pressure derivatives of elastic moduli).
