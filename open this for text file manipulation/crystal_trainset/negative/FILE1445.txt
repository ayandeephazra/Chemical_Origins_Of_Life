Park et al. [30] study axial single deformation of single crystal materials and nanowires in different directions, Wu [31,32], Golovnev [33] study single-axis deformation of Cu metal nanowires at finite temperature and metal has with defects, Lin Yuan et al. [34] has examined single axis mechanical at different temperatures.
