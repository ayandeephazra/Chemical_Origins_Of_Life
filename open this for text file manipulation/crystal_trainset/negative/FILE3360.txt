Other bulk compositions have been proposed for the transition zone, such as piclogite (Bass and Anderson, 1984; Anderson and Bass, 1986), however from Fig. 6 it appears that increasing the basaltic component of a mineralogical assemblage does not result in an increase of VS values to levels compatible with the reference models.
