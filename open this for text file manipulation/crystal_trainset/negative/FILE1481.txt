The results mechanical studies of bulk Ni show: When increasing system size from l = 6.66 nm to l = 7.35, 8.03, 8.65 nm then total energy of the system Etot decreases from Etot = ?659.14eV to Etot = ?871.56, ?1129.42, ?1449.84eV and structure units number FCC increases from 2044FCC to 3154, 4017, 4886FCC and HCP increases from 1943HCP to 1816, 2025, 3887HCP, Amor changes from 13Amor to 354, 856, 15Amor, result is consistent with results [13,61?64] and structure unit number BCC appears at l = 8.03 nm with 14BCC results fully explained in Refs. [35?38,65] lead to E increases from E = 173.04 GPa to E = 181.07, 194.76, 189.83 GPa lead to G increases from G = 113.34 GPa to G = 118.60, 127.57, 124.34 GPa, ? decreases from ? = 57.79 ž 10?4 to ? = 55.23 ž 10?4, 51.35 ž 10?4, 52.68 ž 10?4 and reaches the maximum value Emax = 194.76 GPa, Gmax = 127.57 GPa, ?min = 51.35 ž 10?4 at l = 8.03 nm, the result consistent with results experimental [68] and explained by results [66,67].
