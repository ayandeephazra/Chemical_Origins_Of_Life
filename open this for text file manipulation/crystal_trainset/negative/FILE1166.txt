On the one hand, by considering the size factor, atom A tends to occupy large CN sites, namely 4f, 8i1, 8j; on the other hand, by considering LAs (i.e. Atom A is with the larger total number of electron shells than atom B) or LAe (i.e. Atom A is with the larger number of valence electrons than atom B) factors, atom A tends to occupy small CN sites, namely 2a, 8i2.
