The main conclusion which can be drawn from the results of the present study is that the trend of the bulk modulus as a function of the Lu content results to be determined by two competing factors, namely the mean atomic volume for x ranging between 0.2 and 0.4, and the lattice volume at lower x; this result suggests that oxygen vacancies affect the bulk modulus value above x ~ 0.2. Moreover, the bulk modulus seems to be independent of the presence of C-based nanodomains which are stable within the F structure starting from x ? 0.3. The observed trend is in agreement with data of Sm- and Gd-doped ceria available in the literature.
