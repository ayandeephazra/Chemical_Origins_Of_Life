According to the Griffith energy approach [32,33], for the work of formation and the radius of a critical-sized void in the form of a circular lens in an isotropic solid we have(8)W*=2?3?sv3?23(1?v)2p4, R*=??sv?(1?v)p2where v is the Poisson ratio, and ?sv is the crystal?gas specific interfacial free energy.
