The derived KS and (?KS/?P)T were further converted to the isothermal bulk modulus (KT) and its pressure derivative at constant temperature (?KT/?P)T using the following thermodynamic relations (Poirier, 2000):KT0=KS0/(1+??T), (?KT/?P)T=(1+??T)?1[(?KS/?P)T??T/KT0(?KT/?T)P], where (?KT/?T)P is the temperature derivative of the KT at constant pressure, KT0 is the isothermal bulk modulus at ambient conditions, ? is the thermal expansion coefficient, and ? is the Gru?neisen parameter.
