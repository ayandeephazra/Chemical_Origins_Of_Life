The evolution of the partially nanocrystalline microstructures may be attributed to the following crystallization characteristics of the amorphous alloy: (1) The crystallization occurs by steps; and (2) The residual amorphous phase (associated with the second crystallization peak) changes towards higher crystallization temperature as the crystallization proceeds, which makes the residual amorphous phase more stable and limit the growth of the precipitated crystals.
