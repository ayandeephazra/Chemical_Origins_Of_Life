The uncertainty of the volume is relatively larger than the data reported by Hilairet et al. (2006a) and Nestola et al. (2010) because we used the energy dispersive X-ray method with the large volume press and a solid pressure medium while the previous studies used the angle dispersive X-ray method with the diamond anvil cell and a liquid pressure medium.
