The crystal will deform after the application of the strain to the crystal, and the corresponding stresses ? for the deformed crystals due to each set of applied strains can be calculated from first-principles:(2)?=(?1?2?3?4?5?6) According to Hooke's Law, the relationship between the strain and stress is ? i = C ij ? j, where C ij are the elastic stiffness constants, forming a 6 ž 6 matrix.
