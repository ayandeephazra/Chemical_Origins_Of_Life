The 13 C ij?s and density of diopside at each pressure were calculated from measured sound velocities in different phonon directions using the procedure outlined by Sinogeikin and Bass (2000), where a linearized least-squares method was applied for the inversion of velocities for C ij?s (Weidner and Carleton, 1977).
