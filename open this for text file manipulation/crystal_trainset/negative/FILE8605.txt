We compute the phonon spectra and carry out quasiharmonic calculations to study the temperature-dependence of the lattice parameter (thermal expansion coefficient), specific heats at constant pressure and volume C p and C v, isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli B T and B S as a function of temperature.
