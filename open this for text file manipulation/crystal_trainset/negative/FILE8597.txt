Attempts to go beyond pair potentials, apart from embarking on full ab initio electronic structure-based calculations [3], involve an embedded atom model (EAM) [4] and similar methods [5,6], where the total energy of the static solid is expressed as a sum of pair-potentials plus an empirical volume/density-dependent term or an electronic band(bond) energy term [7].
