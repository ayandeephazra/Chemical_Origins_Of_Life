As shown in previous studies, orthopyroxene with the space group Pbca transforms to high-pressure C2/c clinoenstatite at the relevant pressure and temperature conditions of the upper mantle (e.g. Shinmei et al., 1999; Bromiley and Bromiley, 2006; Yu and Wentzcovitch, 2009; Finkelstein et al., 2015), and we assumed that the OEN phase (Pbca) transitions into the HP-CEN phase (C2/c) at 250km (?8GPa).
