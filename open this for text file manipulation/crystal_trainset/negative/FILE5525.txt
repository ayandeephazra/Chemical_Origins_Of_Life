Following the procedure explained in Refs. [10,12,13] and taking into account the (thermal) volume expansion coefficient as well as the dB/dT value measured at T =300K by Gerlich and Smith [32], we find s f?10 k B (where k B is the usual Boltzmann constant) which is comparable to that found in alkali halides [8].
