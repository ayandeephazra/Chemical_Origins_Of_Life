Despite the previous studies at high pressure provided a general view of the compressional behavior of ettringite, a description of the deformation mechanisms at the atomic scale is still missing, as the quality of the X-ray powder diffraction data at high pressure, coupled with the structural complexity of ettringite, hindered the structure refinements.
