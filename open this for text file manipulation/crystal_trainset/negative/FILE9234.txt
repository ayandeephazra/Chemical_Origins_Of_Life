Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns for the bulk glass alloy annealed for 600 s at 753, 773 and 823 K, respectively, on which two phenomenons can be found, one is that the amounts of Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds increase because their diffraction peaks become strong, and the other is that the diffraction peaks for Zr2Cu and Zr4Al3 compounds broaden because of the formation of nanostructure with increasing annealing temperature by phase separation.
