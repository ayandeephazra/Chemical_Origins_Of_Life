Beyond the recent applications to the case of silicon [33] and Si1?x Ge x alloys [34?36], the cB? model has been earlier successfully applied to the study of various defect processes in a multitude of solids including metals [37,38] alkali halides [39,40], alkaline earth fluorides [41,42], silver halides (e.g., see Ref. [43]), fluoride superionic conductors, e.g., ? ? PbF 2 [30], in a variety of oxides, for example, in UO2 and ThO2 which are useful for nuclear fuel applications [44,45], in anatase TiO2 [46], in Li5FeO4 [47] and Li2CuO2 [48] that are candidate materials as cathode in lithium ion batteries and in Na2MnSiO4 which is a promising positive electrode material in rechargeable sodium ion batteries [49] as well as for Si diffusing in silicates [50] and aluminum in MgO [51], oxygen self-diffusion in minerals [52,53] etc.
