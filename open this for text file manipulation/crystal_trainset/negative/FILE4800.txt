On the other hand, recent experimental and theoretical studies on the phase diagram of magnesite have shown that magnesite remains stable in the MgCO3 form at expected P?T conditions of the lower mantle, whereas new high-pressure phases of magnesite have been reported to occur at lowermost-mantle conditions (Isshiki et al., 2004; Oganov et al., 2008; Boulard et al., 2011), making magnesite a potential major deep-carbon host in the deeper parts of the mantle.
