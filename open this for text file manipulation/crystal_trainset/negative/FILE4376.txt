In this work, Lu-doped ceria is taken as a model to study the high pressure structural features of a system where the effect of oxygen vacancies prevails over the Ce4+/RE3+ size difference in determining the cell parameters of the F phase; this occurs due to the close similarity of the Ce and Lu ionic radii with coordination number 8 (rCe4+ [CN8] = 0.97, rLu3+ [CN8] = 0.977 A?, from [16]), which strongly reduces the dimensional contribution.
