With the aim of evaluating the contribution of ShyB fabrics to the observed shear wave anisotropy in deep subduction zones, the development of preferential alignment of ShyB crystals upon plastic deformation was simulated employing the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) code of Lebensohn and Tome (1993).
