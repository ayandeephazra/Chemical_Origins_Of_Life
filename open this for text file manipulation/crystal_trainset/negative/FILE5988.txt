The second change of the elastic behavior could be also triggered by the coordination environment of the extraframework cations: the saturation of the NA?O2 and NA?O3 bond length trend (Fig. 6; Table 5) and of CA?O1, CA?O2 and CA?O3 trends with P (Table 5) suggest a change of the configuration of the extraframework polyhedra at P >3GPa.
