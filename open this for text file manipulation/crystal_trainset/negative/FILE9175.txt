Lin et al. [21] investigated the effect of oxygen impurity on crystallization of an undercooled bulk glass forming Zr52.5Ti5Ni14.6Cu17.9Al10 alloy, found that the oxygen content strongly affects the crystallization incubation time due to the oxide or oxygen stabilized phases acting as heterogeneous nucleation sites during the transition of liquid to solid.
