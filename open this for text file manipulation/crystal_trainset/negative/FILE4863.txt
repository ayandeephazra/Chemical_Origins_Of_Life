Based on our high P?T elasticity results for single-crystal magnesite, we have calculated the aggregate VP and VS profiles of magnesite using the Voigt?Reuss?Hill averages along an expected geotherm for cold subducted slabs and for the normal upper mantle, respectively (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981; Brown and Shankland, 1981; Peacock, 2003) (Fig. 8 ).
