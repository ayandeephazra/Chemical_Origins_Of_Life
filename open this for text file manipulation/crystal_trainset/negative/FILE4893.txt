Recent results on the lattice preferred orientation (LPO) or fabrics have shown that calcite can develop a moderately strong crystallographic preferred orientation with the c-axes sub-perpendicular to a foliation developed during localized high-pressure deformations (Brady et al., 2004), which can be used as an analog to understand the deformation of magnesite in the mantle.
