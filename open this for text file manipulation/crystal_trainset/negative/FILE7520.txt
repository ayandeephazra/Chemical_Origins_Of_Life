Following the work of Xu et al. [392], the surface energy of SnO2 under thermodynamic equilibrium, S ? can be written from Eq. (37) asS?=12A(Etot,surf-NSn?Sn-NO?O)=12AEtot,surf-NSn?SnO2,bulk+NSn-NO2?O2,gaswhere ?i is the elemental chemical potential and N i is the number of corresponding atoms in the surface supercell.
