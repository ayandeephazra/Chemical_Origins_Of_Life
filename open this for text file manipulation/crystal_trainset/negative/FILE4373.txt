In particular, while the presence of a larger amount of defects in thin films with respect to bulk samples determines a remarkable decrease in ionic conductivity [25], the reduction of the layer thickness generally promotes at the same time a significant conductivity increase, which is driven by the controlled interface lattice mismatch between the ionic conductor and the substrate [24,26].
