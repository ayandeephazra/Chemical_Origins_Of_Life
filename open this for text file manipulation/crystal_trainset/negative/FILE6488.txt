The robustness of the best-fit solution and the reliability of the derived Cij components, including the shear and off-diagonal constant, is confirmed by the good agreement between the axial compressibilities ?i (i = a, b and c) calculated from the compliance constants (Sij = Cij ?1) (i.e., see Gatta et al., 2008) derived in this study and those determined by Crichton et al. (1999) from single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies (Fig. S3).
