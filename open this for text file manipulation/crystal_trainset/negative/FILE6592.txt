The results presented in Fig. 10 show that the maximal polarization anisotropy, ASPo, displayed by textured ShyB at the pressures of the lower transition zones (0.6?1.1%) fall into the range of shear wave splitting (between 0.9ñ0.3%) measured in the vicinity of deep subducting zones including Tonga and Sangihe (Chen and Brudzinski, 2003; Di Leo et al., 2012; Wookey et al., 2002).
