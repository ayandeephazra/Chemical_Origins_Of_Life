An analogous decrease is revealed in Y-, Gd- and Sm-doped ceria as a function of the RE content, but only up to a certain dopant concentration (10?20% mol Ce substitution) [45,46]; at higher doping ion content, on the contrary, it starts increasing even if the vacancies amount further increases, meaning that the elastic modulus value is bound not only to the vacancies content.
