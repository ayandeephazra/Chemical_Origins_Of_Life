in order to further analyze the bulk modulus of srn2 and sr n3 2  we calculated the bonding strength via computing the values of icohp  which shows stronger sr–n covalent bonds in srn2 than that in sr n3 2  leading the larger value of bulk modulus than that of sr n3 2.,contradiction

the srn2 underwent a possible phase transition from a tetragonal structure into an orthorhombic structure at 12.0 gpa.,contradiction
the larger bulk modulus of srn2 is attributed to the stronger covalent strength between sr and n atoms in srn2  which is confirmed by our theoretical calculations.,contradiction

the average hv from the empirical formula developed by ourselves37 are 12–26 gpa  tables s1 and s2†   which is consistent with experimental value of 7.0–21.7 gpa.46 among them  ta2al2b2  cr2al2b2  mo2al2b2  w2al2b2  sc2alb2  cr2alb2  mo2alb2  w2alb2  mn2alb2 possess higher modulus and hardness than other mab phases.,contradiction
thus  cr2alb2  mo2alb2 w2alb2 with high modulus  high hardness and low elastic anisotropies are highly anticipated for future material applications.,contradiction

in orthorhombic materials  the cauchy pressure can be defined for the three different crystal directions: pa = c23–c44  pb = c13–c55  and pc = c12–c66  while is also an indicator of ductile behavior.,contradiction
as listed in tables s1 and s2 † the cauchy pressure of w2alb2  co2alb2 and ni2alb2 are positive in all the three directions.,contradiction
moreover  there is relation of intralayer b–b  b–m bond stiffness as cr2alb2 < mn2alb2 < fe2alb2  which also agrees with the relation of experimental hv of three 212-mab phases cr2alb2  7.0 gpa  < mn2alb2  9.6 gpa  < fe2alb2  14.7 gpa .10 analogously  some hypothetical compounds of tc2al2b2  tc2alb2 and w2alb2 probably possess higher hv value due to their higher bond stiffness of b–b and b–m bonds.,contradiction
as listed in tables s3 and s4 † mn2al2b2  sc2alb2  zr2alb2 and nb2alb2 have lower ratios  suggesting the contributions from interlayer weak m–al  al–b  al–al bonds to mechanical properties are also important  which will weaken the modulus and hardness to some extent.,contradiction
the ideal tensile strength for 222-mab are about 11–16 gpa from c axis  and the ideal tensile strength of 212-mab compounds are 13–39 gpa  respectively.,contradiction

compared with bulk iron the substitution of cr for fe promotes he migration between octahedral interstitials and hinders he diffusion between tetrahedral interstitials.,contradiction
it can be concluded that in model s1 and its bulk iron  helium atom may realize the diffusion from t1 to t3  but the presence of cr obstructs the migration of helium from t3 to t4 to some extent.,contradiction
for model s2 and its bulk iron  we found that the presence of cr atom in the alloy structures greatly restrains the diffusion of a single helium atom  which seems to be trapped in tetrahedral interstitial and cannot escape.,contradiction
according to x-ray diffraction experiments  zn2v2o7 experiences three structural phase transitions under relative small compression  pressure < 11 gpa   while in the other compounds there are no phase transitions in the same pressure range.7 in particular  in zn2v2o7 the transition from the ambient-pressure monoclinic polymorph  α-phase  to another monoclinic polymorph  β-phase  occurs at 1.1 gpa  ref. 7  and subsequent transitions take place at 3.8 gpa   to a triclinic polymorphs named as γ-phase  and 10.8 gpa  post-γ-phase .7 for two of the high-pressure  hp  polymorphs  β and γ  a crystal structure has been proposed from previous x-ray diffraction studies; however  the crystal structures have not been properly solved.7 the proposed structures involve large changes in the unit-cell volume and a modification of the coordination polyhedra.,contradiction
density-functional theory  dft  calculations have proven to be a quite efficient tool to study the hp behavior of ternary oxides  and in particular vanadates.9–12 in this work  we will use this technique to examine the existence of pressure-driven phase transitions in zn2v2o7.,contradiction
variable pressure studies ≤4.8 gpa indicate that densification of the unit cell induces the reverse effect  as the occupancy of the o 2  site increases and the palmierite contribution is suppressed.,contradiction
our results strongly suggest that by 5.2 gpa the o 3  position will be completely empty as the 9r unit cell stabilises with a network of octahedral mo6 units.,contradiction
pressure induces a flattening of m 1 o4 tetrahedra in the palmierite layers  as m 1 o6 octahedra become more regular in geometry.,contradiction
bond valence site energy calculations show that pressure increases the height of all energy barriers to migration along the three-dimensional diffusion pathways  increasing the energy of the dominant pathway from 0.35 to 0.95 ev.,contradiction
the relaxation energy  e2  disappears above 2.8 gpa  when the average polyhedral distortion  σ r   falls below 0.07 å  indicating the existence of a critical minimum.,contradiction
in particular  it has been reported that zn2v2o7  with a bulk modulus of 58 gpa  ref. 7   is extremely more compressible that related vanadates like znv2o6 and zn3v2o8  with bulk moduli of 129 and 120 gpa  respectively .,contradiction
therefore  variable pressure physical property measurements are warranted in order to investigate the use of these materials for multiparameter  p–t–h  triple sensors based on their conductivity response to pressure  temperature and humidity stimuli.,contradiction
we have reported the pressure response of ba3monbo8.5 between 0.1 mpa and 4.8 gpa.,contradiction
this variable pressure study highlights the inherent flexibility of this disordered material and the ability to subtly tune its hybrid structure using both pressure and temperature.,contradiction
the anionic lattice undergoes a smooth and continuous change in occupancy with p  while the metal cation lattice is more robust to pressure showing no discernible change at pressures < 3.8 gpa.,contradiction
the highly distorted structure of ba3monbo8.5 at ambient pressure becomes less distorted with p  as the average σ r  value falls and the second order jahn–teller distortion is suppressed.,contradiction
these findings indicate that pressure will most likely suppress ionic transport within the ba3m′m′′o8.5 family.,contradiction
the low bulk modulus also explains why such facile structural transformations are enabled with both pressure and temperature.,contradiction
for zto113  two phases were examined: the lithium niobate phase  r3c  space group 161; ln-zto113  and the ilmenite phase  r[3 with combining macron]  space group 148; il-zto113 .,contradiction
the stable phase of zto214 was reported to be an inverse spinel.12–15 if all of the octahedral sites are treated as symmetrically identical due to cation disordering  it is called a disordered inverse spinel zto214  dis-zto214   which belongs to the space group fd[3 with combining macron]m as the normal spinel.15 however  on the atomic scale  the occupancy of octahedral sites by two different metal elements might lower the symmetry of the structure  which is called an ordered inverse spinel zto214  ois-zto214 .,contradiction
for ois-zto214  three configurations were investigated: a tetragonal phase  p4122  space group 91; tetra-zto214  15 an orthorhombic phase  imma  space group 74; ortho-zto214 22 and a monoclinic phase  p1  space group 1; mono-zto214 .,contradiction
note that tetra-zto214 was calculated to have the lowest energy 15 and this was also confirmed by this calculation.,contradiction
the primitive cell of each phase was defined in comparison with the conventional unit cell of the cubic spinel  as shown in fig. 3.,contradiction
tables 2 and 3 show the volume of the unit cell and the bulk modulus for each phase from the lda and gga calculations  respectively.,contradiction
zno in the wurtzite structure and sno2 in the rutile structure were also calculated as references.,contradiction
the volumes and bulk moduli were obtained from the bm-eoss.29 the difference between the energy obtained using the relaxed volume and that obtained using the volume fitted to the eos was negligible  below 1 mev f.u.−1.,contradiction
the calculated volumes of the optimized cells agree well with the experimental data  to within an error of 5%.,contradiction
to the best of the authors knowledge  the bulk moduli of the ternary oxides of zto have scarcely been reported experimentally  making the verification of the calculation results by comparing them with experimental results improbable.,contradiction
in order to verify the validity of the calculation of the bulk moduli  therefore  the calculated bulk moduli of the binary oxides  zno and sno2  were compared with experimental data.,contradiction
the bulk moduli from the lda calculations were close to the experimental values  however  those from the gga calculations were quite a bit lower than the experimental values.,contradiction
the bulk moduli of the three ois-zto214 phases and dis-zto214 are similar regardless of the space group  i.e.  regardless of the configuration of the octahedral sites within the same exchange-correlation functionals.,contradiction
in contrast  the ln-zto113 phase shows a slightly higher bulk modulus than the il-zto113 phase.,contradiction
the elastic and thermodynamic properties of tetragonal be12ti under high temperature and pressure are investigated by first-principles calculations based on pseudopotential plane-wave density functional theory  dft  within the generalized gradient approximation  gga  and quasi-harmonic approximation  qha .,contradiction
the calculated lattice parameters and bulk modulus are in good agreement with the available experimental data.,contradiction
the calculated elastic constants of be12ti increase monotonously with increasing pressure  and the elastic stability criterion and the phonon dispersion calculation show that the be12ti crystal satisfies the mechanical and dynamic stability under applied pressure  0–100 gpa .,contradiction
the related mechanical properties such as bulk modulus  b   shear modulus  g   youngs modulus  e   and poissons ratio  ν  are also studied for polycrystalline of be12ti; the calculated b/g value shows that be12ti behaves in a brittle manner  and higher pressure can significantly improve the brittleness of be12ti.,contradiction
the direction-dependent youngs modulus and bulk modulus of be12ti are dealt with in detail under pressure from 0 gpa to 100 gpa.,contradiction
the pressure and temperature dependencies of the relative volume  the bulk modulus  the elastic constants  the heat capacity and the thermal expansion coefficient  as well as the entropy are obtained and discussed using the quasi-harmonic approximation in the ranges of temperature 0–1600 k and pressure 0–100 gpa.,contradiction
in order to determine the equilibrium structure of be12ti  we first carried out the structural optimization calculation under different pressure  pressure range of 0–100 gpa   obtained the corresponding energy e and volume v.,contradiction
then  fitted above the e and v to the birch–murnaghan equation of state  eos 29 to get the bulk modulus  b0  and its pressure derivative at 0 k and 0 gpa.,contradiction
fitted energy e – volume v relations of be12ti are shown in fig. 2  and the fitting results of the bulk b0 and its derivative and equilibrium lattice constants are given in table 1.,contradiction
it can be seen from table 1 that the calculated lattice constants  a and c  and bulk modulus  b0  are very close to the previous experimental data35 36 even the experimental values were obtained in the 273 k environment  while pressure derivative has not yet been compared with the experimental data.,contradiction
usually  the pressure can deform the material and even cause the phase transition of the material.,contradiction
but for different materials  the effect of pressure on the structure parameters is different.,contradiction
fig. 3 shows the variation of a/a0  c/c0  and v/v0 with pressure in the range of 0 to 100 gpa  where a0  c0 and v0 denote the equilibrium structural parameters and cell volume at t = 0 k and p = 0 gpa  respectively.,contradiction
it can be seen that with increasing pressure  the equilibrium ratios a/a0  c/c0 and v/v0 decrease smoothly  but v/v0 decrease quickly than c/c0 and a/a0  and c/c0 decreases slightly faster than a/a0  indicating that the compression along the a-axis is slightly smaller than that along the c-axis.,contradiction
this suggests that the lattice constant c is more sensitive to external pressure than a.,contradiction
nevertheless  change value of the a/c is not large and it remains almost constant in the range of pressure from 0 to 100 gpa.,contradiction
in the fig. 4 a  and  b   we presented the elastic constants and its increasing rate with pressure of be12ti under various pressures.,contradiction
from fig. 4 a   we can see that all elastic constants increase with applied pressure up to 100 gpa for be12ti.,contradiction
the increasing rate of each elastic constant with pressure is derived from the slope of the corresponding linear fitted curve  as shown in fig. 4 b .,contradiction
according to calculated elastic constants and mentioned formulas in ref. 34  we have calculated the mechanical properties of be12ti under various pressure  such as bulk modulus b  shear modulus g  youngs modulus e  and poissons ration ν  which are listed with other theoretical data in table 2.,contradiction
on the other hand  the bulk modulus b and shear modulus g can represent the resistance to volume change and shape change  respectively.,contradiction
the youngs modulus is related to the stiffness of materials.,contradiction
from table 2  we also found that the bulk modulus b and shear modulus g and youngs modulus e increase with growing pressures till 40 gpa  indicating that the increase of resistance ability to volume and shape  and the stiffness of be12ti is getting harder and harder  and the be12ti becomes more and more difficult to compress as pressure increases.,contradiction
at the same time the value of b is greater than g  implies the principal parameter limiting the stability of tetragonal be12ti is the shear modulus.37 for a tetragonal crystal  the traditional mechanical stability conditions under isotropic pressure are given by the following equations:38 [c with combining tilde]11 > 0  [c with combining tilde]33 > 0  [c with combining tilde]44 > 0  [c with combining tilde]66 > 0  [c with combining tilde]11 − [c with combining tilde]12 > 0   [c with combining tilde]33 + [c with combining tilde]11 − 2[c with combining tilde]13  > 0   2[c with combining tilde]11 + 2[c with combining tilde]12 + [c with combining tilde]33 + 4[c with combining tilde]13  > 0	 3 where [c with combining tilde]αα = cαα − p  a = 1  3  4  6   [c with combining tilde]12 = c12 + p  [c with combining tilde]13 = c13 + p.,contradiction
it is evident that from calculated results the elastic constants of be12ti satisfy all of these conditions above at pressure up to 100 gpa  which indicates that tetragonal structure be12ti under applies pressure is elastic stable.,contradiction
in order to determine the dynamic stability under the pressure considered  we also calculate the phonon dispersion based on linear response  dfpt  for the 2 × 2 × 2 supercell with 104 atoms at 0  20  40  60 gpa and 100 gp in fig. 5 where no imaginary frequencies in the whole brillouin zone of be12ti and do not show any anomaly for all the phonon modes  confirming that be12ti with tetragonal structure is at least stable dynamically up to 100 gpa.,contradiction
meanwhile  we found that the acoustic and optical modes become more compact and frequency range increase as the pressure increasing  when the pressure reaches 100 gpa  the phonon spectrum intervals between acoustic and optical modes have disappeared.,contradiction
as for be12ti  its poissons ratio value has been listed in table 2  we can see that from table 2 all poissons ratio values are less than 1/3 under applied pressure  which means that the be12ti is brittle in nature.39 meanwhile  according to the pughs criterion 41 the ratio of the bulk modulus to the shear modules b/g can be used to predict the whether a material will behave in a brittle or ductile manner.,contradiction
in this study  calculated b/g values for tetragonal be12ti as a function of pressure are shown in table 2 and fig. 6.,contradiction
it is noted that the value of b/g is 0.90 at 0 k and 0 gpa  showing that tetragonal be12ti has a brittle nature under these conditions.,contradiction
when applied pressure increases from 0 gpa to 100 gpa  b/g monotonously increases from 0.90 to 1.09  which is always remaining smaller than 1.75.,contradiction
this indicates that be12ti will also behave in a brittle manner at pressure up to 100 gpa  but it has a tendency towards the development of ductility  indicating that the external pressure can improve the brittleness of tetragonal be12ti alloys.,contradiction
such as phase transformation  precipitation  dislocation dynamics  and microcracks formation i.e.41 usually  the elastic anisotropy can be represented by three elastic factors  which are shear anisotropic factors  a1  a2 and a3  of different crystallographic planes and universal anisotropic index  au  and the percentage of anisotropy in compression and shear  ab and ag .,contradiction
in this work  we have calculated above three type anisotropy of tetragonal be12ti under applied pressure and listed in table 3  the detail calculation equations as follows42 43 where the a1  a2  a3 are shear anisotropic factor for the  001  and  010  and  100  shear planes  respectively.,contradiction
the bv  br  gv  and gr stand for the voigt and reuss approximation for bulk modulus  b  and shear modulus  g   respectively.,contradiction
from table 3  one can see clearly that a1 and a2 are smaller than one  when the applied pressure increases  the a1 and a2 only have slightly changed than that value at zero pressure.,contradiction
as for percentage of anisotropy ab and ag  it is found that as the pressure increases  the anisotropy of ab almost keep constant  whereas the shear modulus anisotropy ag increases gently indicating that tetragonal be12ti is more anisotropy in shear than in compressibility.,contradiction
meanwhile  the calculated value of ag is larger that ab under different pressure  also implying that the shear modulus shows stronger directional dependence than bulk modulus.,contradiction
actually  the anisotropy of material also can be revealed by three dimensional curved surfaces of youngs and bulk modulus on crystallographic directions.,contradiction
for a tetragonal structure be12ti  the direction dependent of youngs modulus  e  and bulk modulus  b  is defined as follows: where sij are the elastic compliance constants  and l1  l2 and l3 are the directional cosines to the x  y and z axes under spherical coordinates  respectively. ,contradiction
from fig. 7 and 8  we can see that the distances between the origin of coordinate and the 3d surface are not same in any direction  and the youngs and bulk modulus have small changes under high pressure  implies that as increasing of pressure from 0 gpa to 40 gpa  the elastic anisotropy of be12ti becomes not more obvious.,contradiction
we have used the quasi-harmonic approximation  qha  to investigate the thermodynamic properties of tetragonal be12ti in the temperature range 0–1600 k and pressure range 0–100 gpa  which has been successfully applied to several materials 45–47 the detail calculation method are presented in ref. 46 and are not described here.,contradiction
to obtain the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus of be12ti at different temperature  we have calculated the helmholtz free energy f v  t  dependence of the volume v  the equilibrium volume and the bulk modulus are obtained by above the formula  1  birch–murnaghan eos.,contradiction
also  clearly  the bulk modulus decreases with the increase of temperature from 0 k to 1600 k  and when the temperature is near 270 k  the calculated result of bulk modulus are close to the experimental data.,contradiction
according to the laws of thermodynamics  there are two kinds of heat capacities in a material  namely heat capacity at constant volume cv and heat capacity at constant pressure cp  the cv and cp can be calculated from ref. 46.,contradiction
meanwhile  the constant volume cv at various pressure is calculated and displayed in fig. 12.,contradiction
it is obvious that the cv at different pressure has a similar trend if compared with the cv at 0 gpa.,contradiction
that is while t < 400 k cv increases rapidly with temperature at a given pressure and decreases with increasing pressure at a given temperature.,contradiction
namely  the variation of cv is dependent on both temperature and pressure at low temperature.,contradiction
the effects of temperature on heat capacity are more significant than that of the pressure for be12ti  and the cv is more sensitive to the temperature than that of the pressure.,contradiction
here  we also plotted the change of entropy with temperature at various pressure in fig. 13 for be12ti.,contradiction
the dependence of the thermal expansion α with temperature t and pressure p is illustrated in fig. 14.,contradiction
the comparison demonstrates that our calculated results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data in the temperature range 300–800 k.,contradiction
in this work  the structure  elastic anisotropy and thermodynamic properties of tetragonal be12ti at different temperature and pressure are investigated using the pseudo-potential plane-wave method in combination with the quasi-harmonic approximation.,contradiction
the calculated equilibrium structure parameters and bulk modulus are good agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results.,contradiction
the calculated elastic constants cij and interrelated quantities g  e  ν show that be12ti alloy possesses brittle nature at ambient conditions and be12ti exhibits no pronounced elastic anisotropy by the 3d surface of youngs modulus.,contradiction
the higher the temperature  cell compression for be12ti at a given pressure is more difficult.,contradiction
the pressure and temperature dependence of heat capacity and thermal expansion are also predicted in the pressure ranges of 0–100 gpa and temperature range of 0–1600 k.,contradiction
heat capacity cv of different pressure is found to increase with temperature and close to the dulong–petit limit at high temperatures.,contradiction
as shown in table 1  the lattice constant a  a = b  is 7.24 å  the value of c is 3.90 å  and the volume is 204.43 å3 for primitive u3si2 by using the method of pbe  which have obvious deviations from the previous experimental and calculated results.,contradiction
the structural parameters calculated by the pbe+u method are closer to the experimental and calculated values  which proves that the calculation method of pbe+u is effective.,contradiction
in order to further determine the dynamic stability of the two structures  the corresponding phonon density of states is also calculated in fig. 3.,contradiction
in this section  the toughness of the material is firstly estimated through bulk modulus  b  and shear modulus  g   where b can reflect the incompressibility of the material  and the g can estimate the degree of deformation caused by shear force.,contradiction
the mechanical anisotropy of the material is then evaluated through the three-position youngs modulus diagram and au.,contradiction
in addition  poissons ratio is also calculated using the following eqn  2 : according to frantsevichs theory  the value of σ could also be used as a criterion for judging whether the material has ductility  and 0.26 is defined as the critical value.39 the calculation results of u3si2  sub-u3si1.5al0.5 and sub-u2.5si2al0.5 i  σ are shown in table 2.,contradiction
for orthorhombic crystals  the corresponding bv and br are the bulk modulus; gv and gr are the shear modulus can be calculated by eqn  4 – 7 :41 for the tetragonal structure  the same variables from shear modulus  as well as the variables from bulk modulus can be calculated by eqn  8 – 11 :42 43 sij is the elastic compliance constant  and cij is the elastic constant.,contradiction
next  the three-dimensional youngs modulus diagram is used to visually explore the anisotropy of elasticity.,contradiction
for tetragonal and orthogonal structures  the three-dimensional youngs modulus is expressed using eqn  12  and  13 :44 45 the isotropic materials would display a three-dimensional spherical structure; otherwise  the solid material is anisotropic one.,contradiction
fig. 4 shows the three-dimensional youngs modulus calculated from the above formula.,contradiction
for u3si2  the maximum youngs modulus is 150 gpa  while sub-u3si1.5al0.5 is 130gpa  and sub-u2.5si2al0.5 i  is 110 gpa.,contradiction
therefore  it can be concluded that the sub-u3si1.5al0.5 still maintains high isotropy  and the youngs modulus of the structure does not change much  while the sub-u2.5si2al0.5 i  shows out of the strong anisotropy  the youngs modulus decreases significantly.,contradiction
by solving the linearized boltzmann transport equation  the lattice thermal conductivity in different directions can be accurately calculated; where the electronic transport properties are approximated with the relaxation time ï„ = 0.68 ã— 10âˆ’14 s evaluated using ï at 300 k obtained from experiments.46 the anisotropic lattice thermal conductivity of u3si2  sub-u3si1.5al0.5 and sub-u2.5si2al0.5 i  is calculated  as shown in fig. 5 aâ€“c   the inset is the curve of kzz/kxx with temperature.,contradiction
this isotope of the thermal conductivity of the phonon is caused by the dispersion phase space and the similar group velocities in different directions.48fig. 5 d  shows the calculated electronic thermal conductivity  ke/τ   u3si2  sub-u3si1.5al0.5and sub-u2.5si2al0.5 i ; and it can be seen from the figure that the electronic thermal conductivity of the three compounds all increase linearly with the increase of temperature.,contradiction
first of all  it is well known that upon compression  anatase bulk tio2 undergoes a phase transition sequence from anatase phase to α-pbo2 phase  and then to baddeleyite phase.22 23 for nanostructured tio2 materials such as nanoparticles and nanowires  however  anatase phase generally transforms directly into baddeleyite phase upon compression.31 34 37 39 43 table 1 summarizes the phase transition sequences of different tio2 materials.,contradiction
for tio2 nanoparticles in particular  the phase transition sequences are found strongly particle size dependent.,contradiction
the anatase to baddeleyite phase transitions was found only in the mid-sized tio2 nanoparticles  i.e.  12–50 nm .,contradiction
outside this range  the tio2 nanoparticles exhibit either same phase transition sequence as bulk materials  when >50 nm  or become amorphous  when <12 nm  upon compression.,contradiction
in this study  given that the electrochemically synthesized tio2 nanotubes are several tens of microns long  i.e.  comparable to bulk materials   the tube diameter thus is the determining dimension.,contradiction
even though the tube diameter of 100 nm is two times larger than the critical size of 50 nm for nanoparticles  the deletion of the α-pbo2 phase is still found upon compression.,contradiction
this observation is similar to that of anatase tio2 nanowires with similar or larger sizes.37 39 therefore  it is reasonable to conclude that  in contrast to nanoparticles  morphology has more prominent effect than size in affecting high pressure behaviors of 1d tio2 nanomaterials.,contradiction
so far  there were several attempts to explain why α-pbo2 phase was hindered in anatase tio2 nanomaterials.,contradiction
a widely accepted interpretation was that nanostructured tio2 has enhanced surface energy compared to the bulk counterparts  although some other factors such as the imperfections of the crystals may also contribute.30 35 43 nonetheless  the rational correlation between the phase stability and dimensions of the nanostructures is still not fully understood.,contradiction
in the raman measurements  contrastingly  no phase transition is found upon compression up to 17.7 gpa  a pressure substantially higher than the transition onset pressure  i.e.  ∼14 gpa  found in the xrd measurements.,contradiction
although neon provides a better hydrostatic condition above 10 gpa than silicon oil  the difference in the hydrostaticity is unlikely the primary factor for the different compression behavior of tio2 nanotubes.,contradiction
in particular  the large tube diameter  i.e.  ∼100 nm  and the wall thickness  i.e.  ∼10 nm  as well as the way the tubes are aligned upon production may result in a much more inhomogeneous pressure response along the radial direction upon compression.,contradiction
considering that raman spectroscopy is a surface sensitive probe while that bulk penetrating x-ray provides information involving long-range orderness  we may conclude that the bulk tio2 nanotubes and especially the inner layers transform to baddeleyite phase whereas the surface layers become amorphous upon compression.,contradiction
two tuning points  labeled as p1 and p2  are found at 6 gpa and 14 gpa  respectively  consistent with the observation in tio2 nanowires reported before.39 for tio2 nanowires  p2 coincides with the anatase to baddeleyite phase transition pressure.,contradiction
interestingly  the p2 in the current study  which is 14 gpa  is also coincidental with the anatase to baddeleyite phase transition pressure identified in the xrd measurements.,contradiction
this coincidence may suggest that the anatase to baddeleyite phase did occur  although undetectable in the raman measurements given the above discussion.,contradiction
based on our earlier high-pressure study of tio2 nanowires  these two turning points are consistent with the three-stage process proposed for the phase transition  which involves the competition between formations of the α-pbo2 phase and baddeleyite phase.,contradiction
in the first stage  0 gpa – p1   specifically  the anatase to α-pbo2 phase transition route may be favored.,contradiction
however  due to the enhanced surface energy  a high energy barrier for the formation of the α-pbo2 structure could substantially delay the transition to the α-pbo2 phase.45 therefore  before the α-pbo2 phase is eventually formed  the baddeleyite phase became the more energetically favored structure in competition with the α-pbo2 phase at the second stage  p1 – p2   as seen in fig. 5.,contradiction
at the third stage  >p2   the phase transformation followed anatase-to-baddeleyite route monotonically  accompanied by the significantly faster increase in the fwhm of the eg 1  mode than the first two stages.,contradiction
fig. 5 fwhm of the eg 1  raman mode as a function of pressure for tio2 nanotubes.,contradiction
p1 and p2 denote the first and second turning pressure points upon compression.,contradiction
furthermore  detailed analysis of the xrd results of tio2 nanotubes allows the understanding of the pressure dependence of unit cell parameters as well as the compressibility in comparison with earlier studies of bulk and nanostructured tio2 materials.,contradiction
the normalized unit cell lengths  i.e.  a/a0 and c/c0  as a function of pressure for the tio2 nanotubes are plotted in fig. 6 in comparison with the corresponding bulk materials.,contradiction
first of all  the c-axis exhibits a linear compressibility that is three times larger than a-axis  consistent with earlies studies on bulk tio2[thin space  1/6-em ]24 47 as well as tio2 nanowires.37 39 the different compressibilities are believed to be associated with the intrinsic anatase crystal structure.,contradiction
moreover  compared to bulk tio2  the c-axis of tio2 nanotubes shows higher compressibility  while the compressibility along a-axis is similar.,contradiction
in general  the c-axis for all the nanostructured anatase tio2 is more compressible than the corresponding bulk material  indicating that the morphology and the crystalline growth direction of tio2 nanomaterials play an important role in the anisotropic behavior.34 37 fig. 6 pressure dependences of cell parameters of anatase tio2 nanotubes in comparison with those of bulk tio2.,contradiction
open and solid symbols denote the cell parameters of the tio2 nanotubes and bulk tio2 cited from ref. 24  respectively.,contradiction
for comparison purposes  the bulk modulus of the anatase phase of corresponding bulk materials  nanoparticles and nanowires are plotted together with tio2 nanotubes.,contradiction
in addition  morphology-induced alterations of bulk modulus have been reported in high-pressure studies of other tio2 nanomaterials.,contradiction
for example  strongly contrasting compressibilities were observed for tio2 nanoparticles with rod and rice shapes.34 the bulk modulus of rod-shaped particles was reduced  whereas that of the rice-shaped particles was enhanced by over 50% relative to the corresponding bulk materials.34 all these observations suggest that morphology plays a dominant role in the compressibility of different tio2 nanostructures due to the different contribution of surface energy states.,contradiction
fig. 7 pressure dependence of the unit cell volume for the anatase phase of tio2 nanotubes in comparison with that for bulk  nanowires  and nanocrystals.,contradiction
the inset figure shows the eos of baddeleyite phase of tio2 nanotubes.,contradiction
dotted lines  dashed lines  and dash dotted lines are the eos for bulk  nanowires and nanocrystals reported from ref. 24  40 and 43  respectively.,contradiction
indeed  in our earlier studies of tio2 nanowires for which the baddeleyite phase has a lower stiffness  the wire morphologies were not preserved.39 finally  the interplay of multiple factors must be considered collectively to interpret the different mechanical properties  phase stability as well as transition sequence of nanomaterials.,contradiction
park et al. suggested that bulk modulus may be influenced by the crystal growth directions of tio2 nanomaterials.,contradiction
the dependence of the calculated bulk modulus on the atomic density is illustrated in fig. 2 a .,contradiction
on the other hand  on introducing h atoms in the a-c films  as shown in fig. 2 b   the bulk modulus as a function of the h concentration increased and then slightly increased.,contradiction
this experimental result showed a similar trend with our dft results  212 gpa at 2.6 g cm−3  351 gpa at 3.2 g cm−3  and 450 gpa at 3.5 g cm−3 ; however  there is some discrepancy since the amorphous phase is characterized by a short-range order and the atoms are bonded in randomly disordered positions due to a phenomenon that does not allow the formation of a regular arrangement.,contradiction
nevertheless  taking advantage of the benefits of the simulation  it is noted that the drastic increase in the bulk modulus is observed by increasing the atomic density of the a-c films  which suggests that it would be difficult for the films hardened by high atomic density to relieve the stress of the individual layers within the overall stack in integrated semiconductor devices.,contradiction
however  the addition of hydrogen in the a-c films has little effect on increasing the bulk modulus even though the sp3 content increases.,contradiction
these requirements become more important and increasingly challenging to meet as the device integrity increases.37 38 to elucidate the mechanism of the increase in bulk modulus caused by atomic density and hydrogen concentrations  more direct evidence for the atomic bond structure including bond length distributions was collected first.,contradiction
fig. 3 shows the calculated results of the bond length and bond angle distributions for the dense a-c film with the highest atomic density of 4.0 g cm−3 and those for the h-added a-c film with the highest h concentration of 31.2 at%  in which the highest bulk modulus is observed  as shown in fig. 2.,contradiction
li et al.39 revealed that the distortion of bond lengths  <1.42 å  and bond angles  >120°  in the carbon network was the key factor for the low level of the bulk modulus.,contradiction
however  after adding h into the a-c film  the fractions are 14.3% and 33.1%  showing similar values to both the bulk modulus and the fraction of the distorted bond length of the ref. a-c film.,contradiction
this indicates that even the smaller bulk modulus than that of the dense a-c film is attributed to the high fraction of the distorted c–c bond relaxed by lattice vibrations during stress calculations using vasp.,contradiction
above 80 w in power  the young’s modulus increases close to linearly and reaches 126.4 ± 6.2 gpa at 115 w.,contradiction
magnetic and structural parameters of tetragonal fe5sib2 compound was studied in applied magnetic field up to 7 t and hydrostatic pressure up to 6 gpa in temperature ranging from 2 k up to tc = 844 k.,contradiction
according to the oliver-pharr method  hardness h shows insignificant ise and the value h = 7.88 gpa was obtained for zr65cu15al10ni10  whereas elastic modulus e shows significant ise.,contradiction
although  the elastic modulus yet shows small ise  we conclude that the nanomechanical properties of considered zr65cu15al10ni10 are around e = 125 ± 3 gpa  h = 6.60 gpa  and the dp model parameters σ o  = 2.7 gpa  and β = 14°.,contradiction
the elastic modulus of an octahedral structure made of ti-6al-4v  which is one of the most well-known materials for biomedical applications  es =113.8  gpa  with 50% porosity is lower than 8gpa  see fig. 11 for e/es .,contradiction
for example  the values of shear modulus of mg65cu25tb10 were 19.4 gpa and 19.6 gpa reported by wang et al. [34] and chen et al. [39]  respectively.,contradiction
thus  the mean of 19.5 gpa was used in the following analysis for the shear modulus of mg65cu25tb10.,contradiction
thus  the subset containing x p1  v mm  and s mix/r  which had an rmse of 9.531 gpa  was considered as the best subset for bulk moduli.,contradiction
when considering pauling electronegativity  higher electronegativity corresponds to stronger atomic bonding  and therefore higher bulk moduli. 27 g1fâˆî±1=1vmm  28 g2fâˆî±2=1vmmâˆ’2smix/r  29 b1fâˆî²1=14169+2vmm3  30 b2fâˆî²2=1366xp12vmm+4xp12+456214âˆ’vmm2,contradiction
for example  if the ti-based bmgf needs to possess a lower modulus about 5 gpa and a lower strength about 120 mpa  the fit line predicts that the foam should possess a density about 1.6 g/cm3 and a porosity volume fraction of ∼75%.,contradiction
the measured young’s moduli and yield strength ranging of the bmgfs were ranging from 8 to 53 gpa and from 140 to 730 mpa  which could well match the mechanical properties of human bone.,contradiction
no evidence for a pressure-induced phase transition in ybo3 is observed up to 27 gpa  however we note that an apparent discontinuity in the compressibility at 8 gpa  likely due to the onset of non-hydrostaticity  could lead to the misinterpretation of an atypically high bulk modulus.,contradiction
while some early studies also reported the young’s moduli for binary hexaborides to be 350−400 gpa [35]  a recent study in 2018 reported the young’s modulus of hot-pressed smb6 to be 271 gpa by fracture strength test and 244 gpa by ultrasonic test [59]  which are more comparable with our hehbs.,contradiction
at high temperatures  4000 k  the shear modulus of feo is only 1/5 that of mgo  fig. 2  and thus small differences in g  <20 gpa  due to different averaging schemes causes large differences in the vs.,contradiction
so the bulk modulus for a dilute dispersion of hollow inclusions with interphase becomes 5.8 keffkm=3km+4μmnc+1 where km= 3λm+2μm /3.,contradiction
now  the bulk modulus for hollow inclusion without interphase is obtained by using eqs.  5.4  5.5  or  5.8  with 5.9 n=2μi+3λi3λm+4μi+2μmα3-4μi3λi+2μi-3λm-2μm42μi+3λiμi-μmα3-4μi3λi+2μi+4μm2μm+3λm that  gives a result in agreement with the effective bulk modulus obtained by porfiri and gupta  2009 .,contradiction
at 350 and 400 °c  where the presence of an amorphous phase is detected  young’s modulus is 322 ± 20 and 313 ± 13 gpa  respectively  which is lower than the value for phase pure moalb reported by achenbach et al. [20].,contradiction
