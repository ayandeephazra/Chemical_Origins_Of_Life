The interesting result is in the magnitude of the bulk modulus of B0 = 97 GPa for AlSiP3 and the more than 3 times higher value of B0 = 371 GPa for BCN3, thus placing the latter in the range of very hard materials [8]; whereas the former compound is in the range of soft compounds as the intermetallic ones [25].
