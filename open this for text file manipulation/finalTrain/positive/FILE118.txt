The bulk modulus of SrN2 was theoretically predicted to be 96.08 GPa and 65 GPa using pseudo-atomic calculations with the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE), and the ab initio calculations with the GGA-PBE, respectively, by Zhang et al.20 and Wessel et al.,15 in which the pseudo-atomic calculations results are closer to the experimental results.
