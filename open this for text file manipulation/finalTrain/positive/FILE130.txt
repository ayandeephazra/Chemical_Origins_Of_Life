The B and G of U3Si2, U3Si1.5Al0.5 and sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I) are calculated in this work, as shown in Table 2, where U3Si2 bulk modulus and shear modulus are 87.69 GPa and 65.37 GPa, which are basically consistent with the calculation results of Wang et al.12 and Chattaraj et al.37 In comparison, both of the B and G values for sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5 and sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I) are lower than the values of U3Si2 to a certain extent, indicating that their incompressibility and deformation resistance are weaker than U3Si2.
