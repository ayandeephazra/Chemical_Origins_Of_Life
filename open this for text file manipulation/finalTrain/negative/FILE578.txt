Consequently, we fitted the P-V-T data with the high-temperature third-order BM-EoS approach and obtained the thermoelastic parameters of V 0 =1505.40.33, K 0 =1621GPa, K0 =4.90.2, the temperature derivative of the bulk modulus (K 0 T) P =0.0180.004GPa, and the thermal expansion coefficient at ambient conditions α 0 =(3.20.1)×10−5 K−1.
