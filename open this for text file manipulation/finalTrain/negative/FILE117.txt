The influences of electron localization/delocalization and the tunable bandgap on thermal behaviors such as the electronic thermal conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the figure of merit, and optical properties such as the dielectric function, the excitation spectra, the refractive index, the electron energy loss spectra, the reflectivity, and the optical conductivity are presented.
