We have used the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) to investigate the thermodynamic properties of tetragonal Be12Ti in the temperature range 0–1600 K and pressure range 0–100 GPa, which has been successfully applied to several materials,45–47 the detail calculation method are presented in ref. 46 and are not described here.
