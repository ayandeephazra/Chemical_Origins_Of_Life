For example, strongly contrasting compressibilities were observed for TiO2 nanoparticles with rod and rice shapes.34 The bulk modulus of rod-shaped particles was reduced, whereas that of the rice-shaped particles was enhanced by over 50% relative to the corresponding bulk materials.34 All these observations suggest that morphology plays a dominant role in the compressibility of different TiO2 nanostructures due to the different contribution of surface energy states.
