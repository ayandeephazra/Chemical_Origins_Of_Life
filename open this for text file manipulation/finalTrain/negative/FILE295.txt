The stable phase of ZTO214 was reported to be an inverse spinel.12–15 If all of the octahedral sites are treated as symmetrically identical due to cation disordering, it is called a disordered inverse spinel ZTO214 (DIS-ZTO214), which belongs to the space group Fd[3 with combining macron]m as the normal spinel.15 However, on the atomic scale, the occupancy of octahedral sites by two different metal elements might lower the symmetry of the structure, which is called an ordered inverse spinel ZTO214 (OIS-ZTO214).
