Such as phase transformation, precipitation, dislocation dynamics, and microcracks formation i.e.41 Usually, the elastic anisotropy can be represented by three elastic factors, which are shear anisotropic factors (A1, A2 and A3) of different crystallographic planes and universal anisotropic index (AU) and the percentage of anisotropy in compression and shear (AB and AG).
