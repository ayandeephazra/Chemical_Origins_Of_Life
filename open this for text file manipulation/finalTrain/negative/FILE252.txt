According to X-ray diffraction experiments, Zn2V2O7 experiences three structural phase transitions under relative small compression (pressure < 11 GPa), while in the other compounds there are no phase transitions in the same pressure range.7 In particular, in Zn2V2O7 the transition from the ambient-pressure monoclinic polymorph (α-phase) to another monoclinic polymorph (β-phase) occurs at 1.1 GPa (ref. 7) and subsequent transitions take place at 3.8 GPa) (to a triclinic polymorphs named as γ-phase) and 10.8 GPa (post-γ-phase).7 For two of the high-pressure (HP) polymorphs (β and γ) a crystal structure has been proposed from previous X-ray diffraction studies; however, the crystal structures have not been properly solved.7 The proposed structures involve large changes in the unit-cell volume and a modification of the coordination polyhedra.
