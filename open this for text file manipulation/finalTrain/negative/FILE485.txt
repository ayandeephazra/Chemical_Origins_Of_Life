Considering that Raman spectroscopy is a surface sensitive probe while that bulk penetrating X-ray provides information involving long-range orderness, we may conclude that the bulk TiO2 nanotubes and especially the inner layers transform to baddeleyite phase whereas the surface layers become amorphous upon compression.
