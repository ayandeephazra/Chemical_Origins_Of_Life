Moreover, there is relation of intralayer B–B, B–M bond stiffness as Cr2AlB2 < Mn2AlB2 < Fe2AlB2, which also agrees with the relation of experimental Hv of three 212-MAB phases Cr2AlB2 (7.0 GPa) < Mn2AlB2 (9.6 GPa) < Fe2AlB2 (14.7 GPa).10 Analogously, some hypothetical compounds of Tc2Al2B2, Tc2AlB2 and W2AlB2 probably possess higher Hv value due to their higher bond stiffness of B–B and B–M bonds.
