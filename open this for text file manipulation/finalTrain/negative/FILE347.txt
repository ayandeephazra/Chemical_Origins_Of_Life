At the same time the value of B is greater than G, implies the principal parameter limiting the stability of tetragonal Be12Ti is the shear modulus.37 For a tetragonal crystal, the traditional mechanical stability conditions under isotropic pressure are given by the following equations:38
[C with combining tilde]11 > 0, [C with combining tilde]33 > 0, [C with combining tilde]44 > 0, [C with combining tilde]66 > 0, [C with combining tilde]11 − [C with combining tilde]12 > 0, ([C with combining tilde]33 + [C with combining tilde]11 − 2[C with combining tilde]13) > 0, (2[C with combining tilde]11 + 2[C with combining tilde]12 + [C with combining tilde]33 + 4[C with combining tilde]13) > 0	(3)where [C with combining tilde]αα = Cαα − P (a = 1, 3, 4, 6), [C with combining tilde]12 = C12 + P, [C with combining tilde]13 = C13 + P.
