The related mechanical properties such as bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (E), and Poisson's ratio (ν) are also studied for polycrystalline of Be12Ti; the calculated B/G value shows that Be12Ti behaves in a brittle manner, and higher pressure can significantly improve the brittleness of Be12Ti.
