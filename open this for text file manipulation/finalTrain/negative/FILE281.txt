These combined factors act to increase the energy barriers for migration along all available pathways, changing the energy landscape of Ba3MoNbO8.5. Moreover, we show that there is likely a critical value of σR, and Ba3MNbO8.5 materials with values below 0.07 Å will lack the E2 relaxation energy associated with the distortion of MOx polyhedra.
