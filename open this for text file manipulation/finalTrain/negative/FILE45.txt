In this preliminary report, we discuss the correlation between B–H atomistic vibrations in [BH4]−-anion and melting temperatures of MBH4 (), on the basis of the experimental results combined the Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Both the B–H stretching modes ν1 and B–H bending modes ν2, decrease in the order of LiBH4>NaBH4>KBH4, except for ν1 of LiBH4.
