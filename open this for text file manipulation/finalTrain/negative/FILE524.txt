However, our TiO2 nanotubes exhibit a â€œnormalâ€ transition sequence whereas those produced by Li et al. suggest that only amorphous TiO2 with different densities was observed upon compression.40 Crystalline defects and lattice impurities, which strongly depend on synthetic methods, can substantially influence the structural stabilities at the nanoscale.48,49 Indeed, plenty of crystal defects were identified in the hydrothermally synthesized TiO2 nanomaterials.40 Our Raman results on electrochemically synthesized TiO2 nanotubes suggest inhomogeneous interfacial structures, from which crystal defects can also be inferred, but likely with a different distribution along and across the nanotubes at nanoscale.
