This isotope of the thermal conductivity of the phonon is caused by the dispersion phase space and the similar group velocities in different directions.48Fig. 5(d) shows the calculated electronic thermal conductivity (Ke/τ), U3Si2, sub-U3Si1.5Al0.5and sub-U2.5Si2Al0.5(I); and it can be seen from the figure that the electronic thermal conductivity of the three compounds all increase linearly with the increase of temperature.
