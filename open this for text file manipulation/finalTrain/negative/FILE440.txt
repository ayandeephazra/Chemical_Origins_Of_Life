For orthorhombic crystals, the corresponding BV and BR are the bulk modulus; GV and GR are the shear modulus can be calculated by eqn (4)–(7):41 For the tetragonal structure, the same variables from shear modulus, as well as the variables from bulk modulus can be calculated by eqn (8)–(11):42,43 Sij is the elastic compliance constant, and Cij is the elastic constant.
