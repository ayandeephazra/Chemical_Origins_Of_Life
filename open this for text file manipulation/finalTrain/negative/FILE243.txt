The presence of Cr in the alloy structures promotes the migration of a single helium atom between octahedral interstitials, and at the same time, inhibits the diffusion of helium atoms between tetrahedral interstitials to a large extent, which seem to be trapped in tetrahedral interstitials and cannot escape.
