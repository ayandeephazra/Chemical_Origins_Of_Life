Indeed, in Li et al.’s similar study on TiO2 nanotubes where 4[thin space (1/6-em)]:[thin space (1/6-em)]1 methanol–ethanol mixture as PTM was used, it was believed that PTM can penetrate into the tubes even with much a smaller diameter (i.e., ∼5 nm).40 Based on these analyses, we believe TiO2 nanotubes in the current study have substantially different and more complicated surface or interfacial structures than nanowires studied before or the nanotubes in Li's study.
