The nitrogen bonds are formed as double bonding in both diazenides anions (N[double bond, length as m-dash]N)2− and azides anions (N[double bond, length as m-dash]N[double bond, length as m-dash]N)−.11 The previous studies proved that the N[double bond, length as m-dash]N plays a crucial role in the compressibility of both Sr(N3)2 and SrN2.
