First of all, it is well known that upon compression, anatase bulk TiO2 undergoes a phase transition sequence from anatase phase to α-PbO2 phase, and then to baddeleyite phase.22,23 For nanostructured TiO2 materials such as nanoparticles and nanowires, however, anatase phase generally transforms directly into baddeleyite phase upon compression.31,34,37,39,43 Table 1 summarizes the phase transition sequences of different TiO2 materials.
