In addition, the shear wave polarization anisotropy (ASPo) of ShyB, which is defined as the maximal difference in the velocities of the two orthogonally polarized shear waves in a given crystallographic direction, was evaluated using the relationship:(3)ASPo=100x(VS1-VS2)maxVS,VRHwhere (V S1 ? V S2)max is the maximum value of the difference between the fast (V S1) and the slow (V S2) shear waves along the same crystallographic direction, and V S,VRH is the Voigt?Reuss?Hill average of the aggregate shear velocities.
