Given the fact that carbonates (e.g. calcite, magnesite, dolomite) are markedly weaker in creep strength than other major minerals in peridotite and eclogite assemblages (Schneider, 1976; Karato, 1989) and that they tend to develop fabrics under deviatoric stress or plastic flow conditions (Schmid et al., 1987; Rutter et al., 1994), it is thus possible that seismic velocity anisotropies can be used as a diagnostic feature for detections of the highly carbonated materials containing textured magnesite in the Earth's mantle.
