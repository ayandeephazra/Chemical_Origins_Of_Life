Comparing the calculated results at zero pressure with the available experimental data in Refs. [19,20] reveals that the average deviation of the lattice parameters a of the B2 CuZr structure is about 0.03%, while the average deviations of the lattice parameters a, b and c of the B19 CuZr structure are about 1.8%, 4.1% and 1.8% respectively.
