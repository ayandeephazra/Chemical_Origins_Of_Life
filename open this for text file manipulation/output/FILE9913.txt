Upon differentiating Eq. (1) with respect to pressure P, and considering that the defect volume is given by ? i=(dg i/dP)T, we find(2)?i=ci?(dB/dp|T-1) The Gibbs energy g i is connected to the activation enthalpy h i and activation entropy s i through the relation g i=h i?Ts i , which in the low-temperature range (Ts i?h i) becomes g i?h i.
