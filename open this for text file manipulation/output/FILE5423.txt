If isotropic mechanical properties are assumed, the isotropic pressure of the phase 1 thin film is related to the Young's modulus, Y1, Poisson ratio, ?1, and the biaxial elastic strain, ?12, by Eq. (1).(1)P=?23Y11??1?12 Additionally, the bulk modulus is related to Young's modulus by Eq. (2), where K 1 is the bulk modulus of phase 1.(2)Y1=3K11?2?1 Combining Eqs. (1) and (2) yields the biaxial elastic strain relationship to the pressure, Poisson's ratio and bulk modulus, given in Eq. (3).
