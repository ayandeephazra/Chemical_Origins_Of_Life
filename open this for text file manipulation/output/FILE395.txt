Despite that formation of sp2 bonds on nanodiamond surface causes decreases the length of covalent bonds, it was found recently [5] that structural transformation, induced by surface reconstruction is more complex and, in some cases can lead to the increase of overall lattice parameter of nanodiamonds.
