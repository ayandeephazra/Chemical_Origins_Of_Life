According to the classical nucleation theory, the rate equation for the heterogeneous steady state nucleation density N st can be expressed as [479,480] (49)Nst?kBTúexp-Whet+?GDkBTwhere k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is the growth temperature, W het is the thermodynamic? barrier of nucleation, i.e., the increase in the Gibbs free energy due to the formation of a stable nuclei with critical size, and ?GD is the activation free energy of transfer of precursor nucleolus, Sn and O.
