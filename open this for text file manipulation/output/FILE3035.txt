Clearly, ? of the B2 CuZr structure increases from 0.38 to 0.43 with increasing pressure from 0 to 30 GPa (Table 5), while ? of the B19 CuZr structure increases from 0.37 to 0.41, indicating that the stability of both structures against shear stress are improved under high pressure, as well as their ductility.
