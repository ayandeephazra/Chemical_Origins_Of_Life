In Fig. 5 , the pressure?volume data from both data sets are fit to the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state to determine the isothermal bulk modulus of the nanocrystalline SDC20 and the results are listed in Table 2 where Vo is the ambient pressure unit cell volume, KT is the isothermal bulk modulus, KT? is the pressure derivative of the isothermal bulk modulus, and KT?? is the second pressure derivative of the isothermal bulk modulus.
