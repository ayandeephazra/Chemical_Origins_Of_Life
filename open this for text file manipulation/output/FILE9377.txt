On the other hand, the structure of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 or Zr2Ni with a highly degree of dense packed state is very close to the dense random packed structure of the glass phase, that results in lower activation energy for nucleation of Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 or Zr2Ni and in favour of crystallization for Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 or Zr2Ni compounds.
