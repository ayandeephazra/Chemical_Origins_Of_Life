To understand the phenomenon of transparent conductivity in SnO2, Ki?li?c et al. [68] carried out first-principles calculations of formation energies and electrical (donor, acceptor) levels for various intrinsic defects, such as oxygen vacancy (VO), tin interstitial (Sni), tin antisite (SnO), tin vacancy (VSn) and oxygen interstitial (Oi) in different charge states and under different chemical potential conditions in SnO2.
