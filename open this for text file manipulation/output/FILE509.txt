Within the Generalised Gradient Approximation (GGA), the exchange-correlation functional was approximated by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [23] formulation, while the optB86b-vdW [24] functional was used to capture the van der Waal's interactions required to describe interaction between layers of layered structures.
