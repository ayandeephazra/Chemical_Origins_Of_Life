Thus, Eq. (81) for a cylindrical shaped nanostructure can be written as(83)S?=?tkEth?0Cg?n0VmVsD2Cg(D-2L)2+1When a cylindrical diameter decreases down to the order of nanometer and is comparable to Debye length (D ?2L), the depletion layer has strong effect and the sensor response is strongly dependent on a cylindrical diameter.
