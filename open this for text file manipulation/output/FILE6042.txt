In order to improve the number and the quality of the experimental data in the P-range between room-P and 1GPa, a second in situ HP SC-XRD experiment was performed at the University of Padova using a STOE STADI IV point-detector diffractometer with a full ? circle and operating at 50kV and 40mA with a Mo-K? radiation.
