Thus, the analysis of the experimental data on the gas sensing properties of SnO2 is based on the following factors: (1) morphology and structure, (2) bulk electrophysical properties of SnO2 through the change of the point defects concentration, (3) the change of the height of intergrain potential barrier through the influence on the surface stoichiometry [824] (4) surface reactivity change, and (5) the change of the phase content in gas sensing matrix [808].
