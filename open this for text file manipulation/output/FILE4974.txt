The transition of iron in ferromagnesite from the high-spin to the low-spin state results in a density increase by approximately 6% and an incompressibility increase by 8% (Lavina et al., 2009, 2010; Lin et al., 2012, 2013), indicating that low-spin ferromagnesite can become relatively denser than the high-spin counterpart below the middle part of the lower mantle.
