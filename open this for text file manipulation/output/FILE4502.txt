As evident from Fig. 5 , the mean atomic volume of Lu-doped ceria shows a linearly increasing trend as a function of the Lu content; an inverse correlation can be thus observed with the bulk modulus values within the 0.2?0.4 x range, meaning that the introduction of vacancies plays a key role in this compositional interval.
