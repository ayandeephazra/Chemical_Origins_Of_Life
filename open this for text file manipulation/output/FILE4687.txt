For simple binary crystals, such as NaCl-, ZnS-, and CaF2-type, containing only one species of chemical bond, the properties of the chemical bond in a crystal can be easily obtained from the theory suggested by Phillips, [25] and the related physical properties can be predicted While for complex crystals containing multiple types of chemical bonds, such as RECrO4 compounds, the situation is different.
