By considering the values B = 62.3 GPa and dBdPT = 5.01 reported in the third column of Table 1 of Dewaele [18], as mentioned, we find(12)1BdBdPT?1=6.4ž10?2GPa?1 By the same token, the values B = 66.2 GPa and dBdPT = 4.6 obtained by Dong et al. [16] lead to(13)1BdBdPT?1=5.4ž10?2GPa?1 To visualize the extent of the agreement between the experimental vigi values and the bulk quantity 1BdBdPT?1 predicted by the cB? model, we plot in Fig. 1 the v i values versus the g i values.
