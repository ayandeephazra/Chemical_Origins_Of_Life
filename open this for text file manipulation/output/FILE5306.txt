In a very recent work, Nestola et al. [11] investigated two samples of clinopyroxenes with CaZnSi2O6 and CaMnSi2O6 compositions and compared their compression behaviour, i.e. the volume reduction V/V 0 against the volume at room pressure V 0, with that of other M22+M12+Si2O6 and M2+M13+Si2O6 representatives (CaFe2+Si2O6 [1], CaNiSi2O6 [10], NaFe3+Si2O6 [23], NaTi3+Si2O6 [29], NaV3+Si2O6 [30] and NaCr3+Si2O6 [31]).
