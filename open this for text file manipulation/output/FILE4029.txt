Ettringite-like phase plays different roles in Portland cements: i) in early hydration stages, its crystallization governs the set rate of the highly reactive Ca3Al2O6 (?C3A?); ii) in aged cements, delayed formation of ettringite can promote degradation processes, in particular when limestone is used as a filler and a diffusion of sulphate-rich fluids occurs (e.g., by contact with groundwater or sulphate-bearing soils) [1?4].
