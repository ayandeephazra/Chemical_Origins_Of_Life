Gwanmesia et al. (2006) determined the acoustic wave velocities of synthetic polycrystalline pyrope up to 9GPa and 1000øC by ultrasonic interferometry combined with energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction in a cubic-anvil DIA-type apparatus, and obtained K 0 =172(2)GPa and (?K 0/?T)P =?0.026(4)GPaK?1 by fixing K?0 =3.9. Recently, Zou et al. (2012) measured the thermoelastic properties of synthetic pyrope garnet at higher pressure and temperature conditions (up to 19GPa and 1700K) using in situ energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction combined with a Kawai-type multi-anvil apparatus, and concluded that K 0 =167(3) GPa, (?K 0/?T)P =?0.021(9)GPaK?1, and ? 0 =2.89(33)ž10?5 K?1 for fixed K?0 =4.6. Du et al. (2015) also investigated the thermo-compression of a series of synthetic garnets with the pyrope, grossular, and intermediate compositions up to about 900K and to 10GPa using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction with a diamond anvil cell, and obtained ? 0 =2.74(5)ž10?5 K?1 for end-member pyrope.
