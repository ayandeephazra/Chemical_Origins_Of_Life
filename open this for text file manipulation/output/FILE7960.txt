Considering the nanowire growth originates from the column shaped nuclei, the growth mechanism is a process of the reaction precursors extracting from the saturated Au catalyst, the Gibbs energy difference of a column shape nucleus is expressed as(45)?G=-?gv?r2L+?r2(?+???)+2?rL?where ? and ??? are the nucleus?vapor and the nucleus?liquid interface energies, and the r and L are the radius and the height of the nucleus as shown in Fig. 40 .
