Within the QHA, F vib (V, T) can be calculated by [45,46] (6)Fvib(V,T)=12?q???q?(V)+kBT?q?ln?[1?exp?(???q?(V)kBT)] Here, the sum is over all three phonon branches ? and over all wave vectors q in the first Brillouin zone, and k B is the Boltzmann constant, ? is the reduced Planck constant, and ? q? (V) is the frequency of the phonon with wave vector q and polarization ?, evaluated at constant volume V.
