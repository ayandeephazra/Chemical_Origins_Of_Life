The adiabatic bulk modulus, K S =150.2(1.5)GPa, and its pressure derivative, K S?=4.7(2), obtained in this study are in good agreement with the results of a number of previous compressional studies using X-ray diffraction in the diamond anvil cell or in large volume presses and with computational results (Table 2 ).
