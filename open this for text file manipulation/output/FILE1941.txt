Due to all seven mode amplitudes having an appreciable pressure dependence, the characterisation of the structural basis for the bond compressibility in terms of the dominant mode contributions is significantly more difficult to derive than for measurements made as a function of temperature, where only a subset of modes generally exhibit a significant temperature dependence [40?43].
