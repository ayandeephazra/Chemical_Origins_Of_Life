Although Bolfan-Casanova et al. (2000) doubted the hydrogarnet substitution in majorite, based on the IR spectra of synthesized tetragonal MgSiO3 majorite, Pigott et al. (2015) showed that even with low-water contents, the hydrogarnet defect was likely to form in majorite, thus they inferred that majorite also incorporated water mainly through hydrogarnet substitution.
