By substituting this value into Eq. (14) we get(18)?=2.17We now turn to Eq. (13) which reveals that, since 0?xm?1, the observation of a maximum value in the curve ? versus x demands(19)0???2???1An inspection of the inequality (19)?in view of the ?, ? values determined above in the relations (17) and (18)?leads to the conclusion that this inequality is violated.
