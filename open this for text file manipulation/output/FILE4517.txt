As an example, when oxygen is subtracted from CeO2 or Ce1?x GdxO2?x/2 (for instance by treating samples at 1073 K at oxygen partial pressure lower than 10?17 atm [42], which causes a significant off-stoichiometry), a certain amount of Ce4+ (rCe4+, CN8 = 0.97 A? [16]) is reduced to Ce3+ (rCe3+, CN8 = 1.143 A? [16]) to counterbalance the oxygen depletion; as a consequence of the increase in the average ionic size and the reduction of the Coulomb interaction, the lattice parameter remarkably increases.
