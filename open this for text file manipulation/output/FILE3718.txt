In contrast to the [CO3] triangles are framesets in carbonates sharing three O atoms with the neighbor [MO6] (M = Mg, Fe, Mn, etc.) octahedron, the [CO3] in carbonophosphates act as bridges linking different polyhedral sheets or, can be considered as ?separators? to depolymerize the [MO6]-[PO4] aggregations [38].
