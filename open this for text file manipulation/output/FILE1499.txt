When increasing system size from l = 6.66 nm to l = 7.35, 8.03, 8.65 nm then total energy of the system (Etot) decreases from Etot = ?659.14eV to Etot = ?871.56, ?1129.42, ?1449.84eV, The results obtained consistent with the results [15] and structure unit number FCC, HCP increased, Amor reduced (Fig. 2 and Table 2).
