At sufficiently high temperature, T>?D,r/b, where ?D,r is the reduced Debye temperature (?D) and b is a constant (?2), the inverse of the thermal diffusivity is linearly related to the absolute temperature as given by:(4)1a=bA?D,r T+B?A2 =A?T+B?,where A is related to the phonon?phonon scattering processes (intrinsic lattice diffusivity), B is related to the phonon-scattering processes due to impurities, grain boundaries, etc., and ?D,r is the reduced Debye temperature defined as ?D/3 n, where n is the number of atoms per primitive unit cell (n=14 for zinc aluminate).37 The values of A? and B? for different tablets investigated are obtained by a linear fit and shown in Table 1 .
