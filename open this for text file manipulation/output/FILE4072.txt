Even the O19?O19 distance (distance between the inter-column ?free? H2O molecules generated by the three-fold axis) and the O19?O15 and O19?O13 ones (which represent, respectively, the distances between the H2O molecule and the oxygen atoms of the S1- and S3-tetrahedra) are only slightly affected in response to the applied pressure.
