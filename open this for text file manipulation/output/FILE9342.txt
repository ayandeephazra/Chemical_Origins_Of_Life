Some important parameters are listed below: the Poisson?s ration of the indenter is 0.07; the modulus of the indenter is 1141 GPa; the Poisson?s ratio of the samples is taken to be 0.25 in calculation of the elastic modulus and microhardness; and the size of the spot compressed by Indenter is about ten times of the displacement.
