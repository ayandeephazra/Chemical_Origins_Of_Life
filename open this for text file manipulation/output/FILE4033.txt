The authors found a transformation into an amorphous phase at ~3 GPa and estimated (by fitting only two P-V point) the isothermal bulk modulus (K 0 = ?V(?P / ?V) = 1 / ?0, where ?0 is the volume compressibility coefficient at room conditions) of ettringite to 27(7) GPa, with the linear bulk moduli along the a and c crystallographic directions (i.e., 23(10) GPa and 36(12) GPa, respectively).
