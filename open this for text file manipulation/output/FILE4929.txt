The pressure derivatives of the elastic moduli at 300 K were obtained by fitting the moduli at high pressure using the third-order Eulerian finite-strain equation of state (EoS) (Birch, 1978):KS=KS0(1+2f)5/2{1+[3((?KS/?P)T?5)f]}, G=(1+2f)5/2[G0+(3KS0(?G/?P)T?5G0)f], f=(1/2)[(V0/V)2/3?1], where (?KS/?P)T and (?G/?P)T are the pressure derivative of the KS and G at 300 K, respectively, f is the Eulerian strain, and V0 and V are unit-cell volume at ambient pressure and high pressure, respectively.
