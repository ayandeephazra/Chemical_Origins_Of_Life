The projection of the total COOP onto the corresponding contributions arising from the different atoms (figure 16 ) clearly shows that in the lower region of the VB the interaction N3?C1 determines the positive contribution to the COOP even if all the other carbon-nitrogen interactions are showing a bonding character.
