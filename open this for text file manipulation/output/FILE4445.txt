The intermediate or hybrid atomic arrangement (H), widely described in the literature for the aforementioned systems [9,10,14,15], consists in a solid solution of C-structured RE2O3 domains embedded within the F matrix, observable by X-ray diffraction in the form of a gradual change of some crystallographic parameters from the values typical of F toward those typical of C.
