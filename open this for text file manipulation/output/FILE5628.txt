This clearly exceeds the molecular volume 10.25cm3/mol (considering the nearest cation?anion distance 2.0417A? given in Ref. [6]) which reflects the following [8]: the relaxation volume around the anion- and cation-vacancy is positive, i.e., the neighboring ions around the anion- and cation-vacancy are moving on the average outwards.
