Molokanov et al. [20] studied the microstructural features of bulk glass Zr65Al7.5Cu17.5Ni10 alloy to find that some sphere-like crystals frozen into the amorphous matrix are the intermetallics of Zr2Cu, Zr2Ni, Zr3Al, and some unidentified phases, and found two-stage crystallization from DSC curves by continuous heating the quenched ribbons.
