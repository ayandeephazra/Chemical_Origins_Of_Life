Fig. 3 (a?c) reveals the formation of the net-shape Zr2Ni0.67O0.33 and Zr2Ni phases, it seems that the net-shape phases increase and become continuous with increasing annealing temperatures from 723 to 823 K, the size of the matrix phase separated by the net-shape phase is from about 20 ?m at 723 K to about 15 ?m at 823 K.
