KCaF3 perovskite undergoes two first order structural phase transitions on cooling from the aristotype phase [1], the first, at 560 K, involves the condensation of two zone-boundary phonons with irreducible representations (irreps) M3+ and R4+, the second, at 551 K, involves the condensation of a second mode with irrep R4+.
