The elastic constants Cij calculated by DFT using different functionals (according to the procedure described in section 2.2) were then used to evaluate the theoretical value of the indentation modulus according to Equation (4), and the value obtained for each functional was compared to the experimental one, calculated by Equation (2), as explained elsewhere [57].
