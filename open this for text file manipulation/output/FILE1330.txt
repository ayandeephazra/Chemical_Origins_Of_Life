Differences between the reported values in this work and the aforementioned study by Ching et al. could be due to different methods of solving (ab-initio vs molecular dynamics) and different model sizes (100s of atoms for ab-initio vs thousands of atoms for MD), with both having significant effect on the calculated strain and stress values.
