Recent investigations on silicate compounds belonging to C2/c-clinopyroxene structure family [10?12] suggest that some bulk modulus ? volume trends can be established under specific restrictions, and in particular considering the role of 3d-transition metals at one specific crystallographic site in combination with the valency of the mono- and divalent non 3d-elements.
