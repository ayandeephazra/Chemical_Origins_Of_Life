In addition, although the water content was difficult to determine after the high-pressure and temperature powder X-ray diffraction measurements of the hydrous pyrope sample in this study, Dai et al. (2012) determined the water content before and after measurements of the electrical conductivity of hydrous garnet, indicating a water loss of less than 10%.
