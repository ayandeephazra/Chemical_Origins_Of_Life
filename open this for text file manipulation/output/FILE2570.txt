The thermal pressure (?Pth) was obtained by subtracting the pressure at volume (V) and at room temperature (derived from Eq. (1)) from the pressure measured at the same V and at temperature (T).(5)?Pth=P(V,T)-P(V,300)=?KT+?KT?TVlnV0Vž(T-300) Figs. 6 and 7 show the thermal pressure of hydrous pyrope against temperature and the unit-cell volume, respectively.
