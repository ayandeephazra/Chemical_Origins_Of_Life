In addition, an independent very recent study [18] reported the equation of state of simple solids (including LiF, NaCl and Pb) measured under ambient temperature in Mbar range focusing on experiments using diamond anvils cells with a quasi-hydrostatic pressure transmitting medium (helium or neon) and coupled with X-ray diffraction.
