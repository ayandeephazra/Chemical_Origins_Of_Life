In order to describe the (isothermal) compressional behavior of both low- and high-P polymorph, the experimental V-P data, weighted by their uncertainties, were fitted to a third-order (BM3-EoS) and a second-order (BM2-EoS) Birch-Murnaghan Equations of State [14,15], respectively, using the EoS Fit 7.0 software [16].
