In non-magnetically ordered perovskite-structured oxide systems at low temperatures, the Gru?neisen constant increases with increasing temperature, before either exhibiting a broad maximum (CaTiO3, LaGaO3) or plateauing (SrZrO3, BaCeO3, SrCeO3), unfortunately we lack isobaric heat capacity data for KCaF3 above 300 K and hence its detailed high temperature behaviour is unknown; the high temperature heat capacity measurements around the Pbnm - Cmcm and Cmcm - Pm3 ?m phase transitions are regrettably plotted on an arbitrary scale [7], and therefore cannot be analysed in this manner.
