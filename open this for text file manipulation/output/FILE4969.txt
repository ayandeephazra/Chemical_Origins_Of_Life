Recent geophysical and geochemical studies have shown that peridotite and eclogite are the most likely rock assemblages in deeper upper mantle and subduction zones (Nicolas and Christensen, 1987; Johnson et al., 1990; Spandler et al., 2003), respectively, in which they may contain amounts of CO2 in the form of accessory iron-bearing magnesite, ferromagnesite, with approximately 15 wt.% iron (e.g. Dasgupta et al., 2004).
