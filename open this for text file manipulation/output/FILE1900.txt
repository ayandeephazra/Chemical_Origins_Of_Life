For a self-consistent solution to the characteristic temperatures from a given statistical mechanical model, it is therefore necessary to simultaneously fit the temperature dependence of the unit cell volume and isochoric heat capacity, rather than fit these two variables separately, as has been regularly carried out in the past.
