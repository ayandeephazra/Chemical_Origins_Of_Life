It is worthwhile to point to the shortening of the C?N bonds and its apparent connection with the magnitude of the band gaps: from table III, the C?N2 bond within the ring is the shortest for the AAA-type stacking which happens to have the smallest gap (1.769 eV, 1.692 eV and 0.938 eV for ABC, ABA and AAA respectively).
