Using the lattice parameters 4.084A? for LiH and 4.060 for LiD (see Ref. [3] and references therein), Eq. (7) leads to(17)?=0.018By applying Eq. (15) and using the aforementioned value dBI/dP=3.53 we find n B=3.6. This Born exponent, when inserted into Eq. (16)?upon using also the value B I=32.2GPa?results in (d2B1/dp2)T=?0.09 GPa-1 .
