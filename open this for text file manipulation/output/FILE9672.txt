By using an empirical formula which relates the bulk modulus of tetrahedrally coordinated systems to the length and ionicity of their bonds, it was predicted as early as in 1985 that a material made from carbon and nitrogen should exhibit a bulk modulus higher than that of diamond due to the short length and higher covalence of the C?N bond ?1, 2?.
