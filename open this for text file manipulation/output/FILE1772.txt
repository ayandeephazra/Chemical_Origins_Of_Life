The First-principle calculations were performed by the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the CASTEP code (Clark et al., 2005), where the local density approximation (LDA) with CA?PZ parameterization (Perdew and Zunger, 1981; Ceperley and Alder, 1980) for the exchange-correlation interaction and Norm-conserving pseudopotentials (Hamann et al., 1979) in modeling the electron-ion interaction were respectively adopted.
