Since the transformation strain is a function of the lattice constants of the two phases, the difference between the LDM and MD values can be attributed to two reasons: 1) the LDM values are calculated from 0 K lattice constants, whereas the B2 and B19? phases in the simulations are at 350 K; and 2) the lattice parameters of B2 and B19? (at 0 K) predicted by the MEAM interatomic potential are not exactly the same as the ab initio values used in the LDM.
