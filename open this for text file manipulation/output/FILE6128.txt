Having in mind that the list of potential applications of LaNiO3-based superlattices continues to grow [12?14], it becomes obvious that the deep knowledge of elastic features could be useful for fundamental as well as technological reasons, allowing one to evaluate the critical thicknesses of individual superlattice layers and thereby avoid the formation of unwanted defects, like misfit dislocations, during the growth process.
