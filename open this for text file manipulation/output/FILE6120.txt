In gobbinsite, two compressional changes occur: (1) the first at P >1.1?1.3GPa, probably due to a re-organization of the H2O molecules, (2) the second at P >2.7?3.2GPa, driven by the onset of new framework deformational modes, by a distortion of the tetrahedra, and by a saturation of the compressional trend of the extraframework polyhedra.
