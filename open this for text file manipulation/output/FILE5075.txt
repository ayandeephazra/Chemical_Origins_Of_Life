Mechanisms responsible for size versus strength scaling depend on the material and loading regime (e.g., competition among dislocation glide and grain boundary sliding in metals or weakest link or Weibull-type behavior in ceramics), and at extremely small grain sizes, the scaling relation holds less frequently, with a possible reversal in trend (inverse Hall?Petch behavior).
