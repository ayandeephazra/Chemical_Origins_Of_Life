The absorbance (A), for the bulk and a single layer in bilayer and monolayer, was also calculated using the formula A = 1 ? exp(??(?)?z), where ?z and ?(?) are the material thickness and the absorption coefficient, respectively, was used for bulk and a single layer in the bilayer and monolayer calculation.
