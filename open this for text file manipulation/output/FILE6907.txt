From the expression, it is clear that the transition pressure, PnT, in nanocrystals depends on three components: (1) the volume change for bulk and nanocrystals at transitions, (hereafter, is denoted as Term 1); (2) the surface energy difference between the phases involved, (hereafter, is denoted as Term 2); and (3) the internal energy difference between the phases involved in bulk, (hereafter, is denoted as Term 3).
