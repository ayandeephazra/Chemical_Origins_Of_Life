Energy in the potential is defined as the sum of pairwise interactions combined with an embedding energy term that accounts for the energy in embedding each atom in the electron based density as per Eq. (1):(1)E=?iFi?h,i+12?i,ji=?j?ijrijwhere, ?h,i is the host electron density at atom i due to the remaining atoms in the system, Fi?h,i is the energy to embed atom i into the background electron density ?, and ?ijrijis the core-core pair repulsion between atoms i and j separated by the distance rij Similar to EAM, the modified embedded atom method (MEAM) also follows the form of Eq. (1).
