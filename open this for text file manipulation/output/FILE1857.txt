The crystal system and space group of the room temperature phase was subsequently revised to be monoclinic, space group B21/m (non-standard setting of P21/m) [4], however, high-resolution, time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction showed the revision to be erroneous, and that the space group of KCaF3 from 4.2 to 551 K was indeed Pbnm [5] in agreement with the original analysis.
