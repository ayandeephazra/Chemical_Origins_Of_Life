Though Bezacier et al. (2013) mentioned that the transition does not occur in subducting slabs, except in the core of the coldest slabs where serpentine may be subducted to depths of about 200km, the transition may occur within the coldest subduction geotherms, which have temperatures below ?400øC at ?9GPa (Syracuse et al., 2010).
