For instance, hydrous phases such as ShyB and phase D easily align by a shape preferred orientation (SPO) or by a lattice preferred orientation (LPO) mechanism due to their layered structure (Fig. 2 ) and associated high plastic anisotropy (Mainprice and Ildefonse, 2009; Mussi et al., 2013; Rosa et al., 2013a).
