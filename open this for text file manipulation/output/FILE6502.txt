Geophysical observations in the mantle transition zone (TZ), including seismic low velocity anomalies (LVZ), enhanced shear wave anisotropy, depth variations of seismic discontinuities, electric conductivity and seismic attenuation anomalies have been often related to locally enhanced water concentrations (Abers, 2000; Chen and Brudzinski, 2003, 2001; Deuss et al., 2013; Di Leo et al., 2012; Guo and Yoshino, 2013; Hacker et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2012; Khan and Shankland, 2012; Karato, 2006; Kawakatsu and Watada, 2007; Lawrence and Wysession, 2006; Tonegawa et al., 2008; Tsuji et al., 2008).
