To estimate the crystallization heat of the relaxed sample, we calculated the difference between the full heat effect (i.e. determined using Eq. (10) with T = T f as the upper integration limit) and the heat effect reached upon heating the initial sample up to T g ?643K (i.e. calculated with Eq. (10) using T = T g as the upper integration limit).
