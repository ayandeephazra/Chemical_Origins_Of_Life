Thus, assuming core A and shell B react to produce A m Bn, and with r in(t) and r out(t) denoting the position of the inner and outer boundaries, respectively, of the growing shell at a time t, the outward growth rate of the product layer is [713,714] (67)droutdt=nADA?CArin(t)rout(t)[rout(t)-rin(t)]where D A?C A, and n A denote the diffusivity, concentration difference, and volume density of A in the product layer, respectively.
