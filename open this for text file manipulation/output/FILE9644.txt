Tables 2 and 3 clearly shows that when the temperature is not too high from room temperature, the calculated results obtained from any of the three equations for volume thermal expansion of NaCl and KCl crystals agree with the experimental data well, but at higher temperatures, the results obtained from Eq. (9) present better agreement with the experimental ones compared with those from Eqs. (10) and (11).
