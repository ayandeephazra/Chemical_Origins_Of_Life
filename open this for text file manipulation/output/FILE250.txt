Although U3Si5 has a lower uranium density than some of the other U?Si phases, several advantages have been identified such as the neutronic similarity between a UN-U3Si5 composite and UO2, which would minimize LWR operational differences and improve oxidation resistance compared to U3Si2, another U?Si fuel candidate [10].
