At lower x values, on the contrary, the slightly increasing behavior of B0 accounts for the decreasing trend of the lattice parameter vs. the Lu content, thus indicating that the emptying of the structure becomes effective above a certain vacancies amount, while at lower Lu amount the effect of the lattice size prevails; thus, below this threshold the bulk modulus acts as not perceiving the presence of vacancies.
