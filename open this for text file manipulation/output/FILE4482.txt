In agreement with the previous description, three structural models were refined to properly describe the high pressure crystallographic features of the analyzed samples, namely the F model for samples with x ranging between 0.1 and 0.4, the C model for x = 0.90, and a (F + C) biphasic model for x = 0.80; in particular, for each composition atomic positions refined at ambient pressure [12] were used as the starting values for the refinement of high pressure data.
