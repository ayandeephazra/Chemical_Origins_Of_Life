The shear modulus of an isotropic material can be calculated from the adiabatic elastic tensor according to the formulation of Stixrude and Lithgow-Bertelloni (2005):(13)G=(1+2f)5/2[G0+(3K0G0??5G0)f+(6K0G0??24K0?14G0+92K0K0?)f2]??S?ETH(V,T)V where G0 and G0? are the shear modulus and its pressure derivative at ambient conditions and ?S is the shear strain derivative of the Gru?neisen parameter.
