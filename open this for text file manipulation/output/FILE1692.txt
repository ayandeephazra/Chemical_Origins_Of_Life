In contrast, the Foiles 1986 EAM potential was specifically parameterized by fitting against the elastic constants, lattice constants, and vacancy energies for pure FCC metals [21].The validity of the potential was then demonstrated by accurately calculating a wide range of properties including the surface energy, formation energy, vacancy energy, and geometry of [1 0 0] FCC gold with periodic boundary conditions [21].
