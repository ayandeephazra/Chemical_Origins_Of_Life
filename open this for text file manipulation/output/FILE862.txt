This view is further supported by several studies on improving the properties of ODS steels where B1-type oxides (MgO, CaO, BaO, SrO) have been included in the investigation of their ability to trap He atoms in the iron matrix, influence on mechanical and microstructural properties and resistance to irradiation [12?14].
