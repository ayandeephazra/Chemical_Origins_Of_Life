Synthesized by selected chemical routes, semiconductor nanowires have several extraordinary features such as (i) high crystallinity, (ii) nearly perfect surface unlike etched structures, (iii) ?scalable? diameter controlled by self-assembly, (iv) ideal cross-section for FET leakage control, (v) superior carrier transport due to reduced phonon scattering in low-dimensionality, and (vi) cost-effective chemical synthesis for material preparation.
