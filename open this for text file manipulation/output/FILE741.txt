The absence of desolvation before melting suggests the higher stability of CEL-DMSO than many other solvates and hydrates in the literature, which routinely lose solvent molecule before melting (Aitipamula et al., 2014; Han et al., 1998; Machiste, 1995; Zhu et al., 2019), including 6 isostructural cocrystal solvates of CEL (Wang et al., 2014).
