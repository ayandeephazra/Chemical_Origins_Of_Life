When the B2 loading direction and the corresponding final variant of B19? are known, the modulus of the two phases can be calculated from elastic constants according to [37,34] (1)EhklB2-1=S11-2S11-S12-12S14n12n22+n22n32+n12n32and(2)EhklB19?-1=n14S11+2n12n22S12+2n12n32S13+2n13n3S15+n24S22+2n22n32S23+2n1n22n3S25+n34S33+2n1n33S35+n22n32S44+2n1n22n3S46+n12n32S55+n12n22S66,where n1,n2 and n3 are cosines of the angles between the direction normal to the (hkl) plane and the lattice vectors of B2 and B19?, respectively, and Sij are the components of the compliance matrix.
