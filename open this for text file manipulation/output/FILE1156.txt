The YBO3 bulk modulus determined here (163(13) GPa) agrees very closely with our previous result [13] on YBO3 micro-powders of 164(8) GPa, and shows that in the case of these rare-earth orthoborates optimisation of powder XRD experiments is possible through the use of nano-powder samples without affecting the observed compressional behaviours.
