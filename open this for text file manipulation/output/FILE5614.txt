Among the applications of this model, we refer here to the most recent ones: first, Katsika-Tsigourakou and Vassilikou-Dova [20] by making use of the compressibility [21] of the defect volume [22?24] predicted by the cB? model, achieved in calculating the bulk modulus of a mixed alkali halide crystal in terms of the compressibility of the pure constituents.
