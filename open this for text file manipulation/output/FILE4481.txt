With regard to the biphasic sample Lu80, the ambient pressure compositions of F and C were differently determined: relying on the interpolation of the refined F lattice parameter to the ones of the x = 0.1?0.4 series, the stoichiometry of F results to be Ce0.67Lu0.33O1.83; at variance, the composition of C was fixed at Lu1.8Ce0.2O3.1, i.e. the one corresponding to x = 0.9, since the C cell parameter of Lu80 is very close to the one of Lu90.
