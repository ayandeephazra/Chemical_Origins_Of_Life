From Table 3 it is seen that rhombohedral and monoclinic phases of LaNiO3 exhibit a similarly weak anisotropy in compressibility with ABRhomb.?0.46% and ABMon.?0.5%, but their anisotropy in shear appears to be more pronounced, as the numbers accordingly increase up to AGRhomb.?7.14% and AGMon.?6.43%.
