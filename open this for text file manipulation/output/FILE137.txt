As it is seen in Fig. 4b the shear modulus of five out of six hcp metals (Ru, Ti, Co, Zr, Mg) follows the common qualitative and quantitative trend ? with a decreasing grain diameter the value drops from G ?CS/MT?to the value of approximately 0.4G ?CS/MT?when the grain boundary zone encompasses the whole volume.
