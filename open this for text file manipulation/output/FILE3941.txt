Further results in shear moduli, bulk/shear modulus ratio (B 0/G 0) and elastic anisotropy constants (Supplementary data Table S1) indicate that higher Mo concentration enhances the anisotropy and ductility of the Ni-based solid solution with larger values of B 0/G 0 ratio and A G, in addition to its positive effect on the bulk modulus.
