System energy is calculated as the sum of energy contributions from bonding, over/under coordination, lone pair, valence, torsion, Van der Waals and Coulomb energy respectively (Eq. (2))[15]:(2)Esystem=Ebond+Eover+Eunder+Elp+Eval+Etor+EvdWaals+ECoulomb Bond order is then used to determine the interactions between all atoms in the system by accounting for the various covalent bond types as a function of the distance between atoms.
