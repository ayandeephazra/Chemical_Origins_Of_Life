Roberts and Rowe also reported that the most stable form of the polymorphs of carbamazepine, sulfathiazole, and sulfanilamide had a higher Young?s modulus, yield stress, and true density, and were less compressible and compactible: a longer dwell time was needed to allow sufficient plastic flow and bond formation to occur (Roberts et al., 1995).
