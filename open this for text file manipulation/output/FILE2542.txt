The pressure-volume (P-V) data from the single-crystal (Table 1) and powder sample (Table 2) were fitted to a third order BM-EoS:(1)P=(3/2)K0[(V0/V)7/3-(V0/V)5/3]ž{1+(3/4)(K0?-4)[(V0/V)2/3-1]}where V 0, K 0, and K?0 are the unit-cell volume, isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivative at ambient conditions, respectively.
