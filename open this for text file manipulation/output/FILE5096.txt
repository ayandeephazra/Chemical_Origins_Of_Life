Phase field modeling of polycrystals with grain boundary regions whose properties may differ from surrounding crystals, similar to the present implementation, was reported in [31], in work that considered isotropic fracture energy, anisotropic elasticity, electromechanical coupling, and a kinetic approach to evolution of order parameter fields.
