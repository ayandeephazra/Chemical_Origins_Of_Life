As for the quantity ? it can be estimated by the aforementioned thermodynamical model by the following procedure: substituting Eq. (9) into the well known [15] relation vd=(dgact/dP)|T, we find vd=cact[(dB/dP)|T?1]?, which when inserted into Eq. (4), gives(14)(??)?d?I=1?BId2BIdP2|TdBIdP|T?1The quantities dBI/dP and d2BI/dP2, when they are not experimentally accessible, can be estimated from the modified Born model according to [17] (15)dBI/dP=(nB+7)/3and(16)BI(d2BI/dP2)=?(4/9)(nB+3)where nB is the well known [15] Born exponent.
