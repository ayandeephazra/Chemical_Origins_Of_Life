In the context of water storage at high pressures, garnet is a particularly important phase because grossular (Ca3Al2Si3O12) is known to be capable of dissolving up to 20.80wt% H2O (Passaglia and Rinaldi, 1984; O?Neill et al., 1993) and significant water content has been found in pyropic garnet from xenoliths (Bell and Rossman, 1992).
