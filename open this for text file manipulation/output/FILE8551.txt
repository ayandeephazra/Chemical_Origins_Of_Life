This process greatly increases both the quantity of oxygen that can repopulate vacancies on the SnO2 surface and the rate at which this repopulation occurs, resulting in a greater (and faster) degree of electron withdrawal from the SnO2 (and at a lower temperature) than for the pristine metal oxide nanowire.
