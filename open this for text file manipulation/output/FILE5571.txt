Previous experiments on P-induced penetration of external H2O molecules showed that this unusual phenomenon can give rise to: (1) new extra-framework sites, with significant change of the configuration of the extra-framework population (e.g., in fibrous zeolites or in laumontite, [31,32]) or (2) increasing the occupancy factors of sites partly occupied at room P without new sites (e.g., [33]).
