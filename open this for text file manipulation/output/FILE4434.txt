In the simulations presented here, the martensitic transformation occurs through the formation of such bands when the austenitic bulk is loaded both along the ?110? or ?100? orientation, whereas the transformation progresses through the formation of a multi-variant B19? structure and the subsequent reorientation into a single-variant B19? when loaded along the ?111? orientation.
