This includes not only individual hydrostaticity of pressure at the particular experimental conditions, but also the conversion of adiabatic to isothermal bulk moduli as individually obtained from various analytical techniques (e.g. ultrasonics, Brillouin scattering, volume and length scale measurements on static compression, dynamic shock-wave experiments).
