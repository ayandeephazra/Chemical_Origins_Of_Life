The biaxial elastic strain is inversely dependent on the bulk modulus of phase 1.(3)?12=?36P1??1K11?2?1 In order to create maximum strain in the thin film ionic conductor without misfit dislocation generation, which have been shown to decrease ion transport [17,35], a material with low elastic modulus is most desirable to reduce the volume elastic energy of the film [16].
