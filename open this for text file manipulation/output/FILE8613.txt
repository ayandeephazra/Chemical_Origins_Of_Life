This includes depositing a photoresist (PR) layer by a spinning method, exposing the PR layer to ultraviolet light using a photomask of an interdigital electrode pattern, removing the exposed area and depositing trilayers of Au (3nm)/Pt (100nm)/Ni (50nm) in sequence by a sputtering method, and finally removing the remaining PR layer by a lift-off process.
