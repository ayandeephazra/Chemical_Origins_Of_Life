The Raman spectra collected at room conditions after the high-pressure experiments show, unambiguously, that a residual fraction of methanol (and/or ethanol and probably even extra H2O) still resides into the zeolitic sub-nanocavities; these extra-molecules are spontaneously released into the atmosphere after a few days.
