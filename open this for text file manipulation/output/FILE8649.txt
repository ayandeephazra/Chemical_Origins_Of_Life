In this work, we systematically study the elastic properties of the R phase, M 1 phase and M 2 phase VO2, including single-crystal elastic constants c ij's, polycrystalline bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and elastic anisotropy characteristic, and discuss the pressure dependence of c ij's.
