The structural distortion induced by applying pressure is most easily appreciated by referring the unit cell to the pseudocubic subcell metric, which for a perovskite-structured phase with space group Pbnm is monoclinic: a pc = b pc =? c pc, ?pc = ?pc = 90ø =? ?pc (transformation from the orthorhombic unit cell: 1/2, ?1/2, 0/1/2, 1/2, 0/0, 0, 1/2), and this pressure dependence is illustrated in Fig. 4 .
