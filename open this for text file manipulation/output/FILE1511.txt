When adding structure BCC then Etot decreases suddenly lead to E increase and reach the maximum value Emax = 194.76 GPa (Fig. 4), result is perfectly consistent with previously published as: Effect of atoms density on the mechanical properties of materials by the Voigt equation, Spriggs, Hashim-Strickman correlation function [66] and Ito et al. [67] for that the decreasing atoms distance leads to increased modulus of elasticity and is consistent with the empirical results of bulk Ni at T = 293 K is E = 200Gpa.
