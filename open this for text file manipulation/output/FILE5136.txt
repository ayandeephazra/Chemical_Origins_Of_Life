Let C0 denote the elasticity tensor of the perfect material:(2.15)CIJKL0=CIJKL??=0=?2W??IJ?KL?=0.Bulk modulus k0 for the undamaged material is defined as usual for crystals of cubic, hexagonal, or trigonal symmetry [45,46]:(2.16)k0=(C11+C12)C33-2C132C11+C12+2C33-4C13.where C???CIJKL0 are initial/undamaged elastic constants in Voigt notation (Greek indices running from 1 to 6).
