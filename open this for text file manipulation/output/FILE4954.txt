Briefly, these values were further evaluated along a normally expected upper-mantle geotherm (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981; Brown and Shankland, 1981) and a cold slab geotherm (Peacock, 2003) by extrapolating the experimentally-derived elastic moduli and their P?T derivatives to relevant P?T conditions using the third-order Eulerian finite-strain and Birch?Murnaghan EoS (Birch, 1978).
