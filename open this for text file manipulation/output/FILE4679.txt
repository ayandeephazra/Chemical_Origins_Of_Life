For a fictitious binary crystal (AmBn)?, its lattice energy U(mn)? contains two parts, namely ionic part U(mn)i? and covalent part U(mn)c?, and the total lattice energy of a complex crystals can be obtained from summarizing the contributions of the decomposed binary crystals by using the following equations:(7)U(mn)?=U(mn)i?+U(mn)c? (8)U=??U(mn)? The lattice energy density u? of a binary crystal is defined as(9)u(mn)?=U(mn)?NAVn?vb?where NAV is the Avogadro constant, n? is the number of the chemical bond in one formula unit, vb? is the chemical bond volume of the chemical bond.
