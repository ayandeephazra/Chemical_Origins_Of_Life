One way to check the quality of the fitted EOS is to compare the derived bulk modulus with that obtained by linear moduli through the relation [62] K0,lm=3?(1Ma,0+1Ma,0+1Mc,0)?1, where Ma,0 and Mc,0 are the linear moduli along the a- and c-axis, respectively, which define the linear compressibility at zero pressure.
