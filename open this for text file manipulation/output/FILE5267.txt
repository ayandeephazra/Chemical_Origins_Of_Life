Effects of the following microstructure characteristics and material properties on quasi-static tensile fracture have been investigated: initial lattice orientation; cleavage energy anisotropy; relative strength, stiffness, and thickness of grain boundary layers; and grain size (holding normalized regularization width fixed).
