However, very recently, Singh [10] suggested another different expression for the diffusional driving force existing in ionic material with NaCl structure as follows:(4)Fr=6r2T?KT.Expression (4) is derived from Eq. (1) with the help of the following Maxwell's thermodynamic relations:(5)(dSdV)T=(dPdT)V=?KT,and the relationship V=2r3 for crystals with NaCl structure, where V is the volume and P the pressure.
