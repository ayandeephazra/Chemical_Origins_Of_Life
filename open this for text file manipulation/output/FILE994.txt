We see further that the oxides such as IrO, HfO, WO, NbO, RhO, ReO, MoO, OsO, TiO, CoO, VO, CrO, NiO, CuO, and FeO, are less stable in the iron matrix since their exothermic formation energies are manifestation of reaction between MO and Fe where exchange of M for Fe or nucleation of M-Fe-O oxide is favorable.
