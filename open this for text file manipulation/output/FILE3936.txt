Based on the equilibrium Wigner-Seitz radii of Ni-Mo solid solutions obtained in our previous EMTO calculations [30], the elastic parameters including equilibrium bulk moduli, elastic constants and shear moduli at 0 K were calculated first and compared with the VASP results obtained using 16-atom supercell models.
