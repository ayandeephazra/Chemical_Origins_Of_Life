A single crystal of armstrongite (same specimen described by Mesto et al. [5] and in Lacalamita et al. [8]) from Khan Bogdo, Mongolia, with a prismatic habit (?50 ž 20 ž 20 ?m in size) was selected on the basis of its optical quality for the high-pressure experiment, performed at the ID15B beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France.
