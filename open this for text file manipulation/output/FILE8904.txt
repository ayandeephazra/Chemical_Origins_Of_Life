Moreover, it has a strong metal?support interaction preventing e.g. platinum and platinum/tin to sinter.7 Finally, zinc aluminate can be used as a second phase in glaze layers of white ceramic tiles to improve wear resistance and mechanical properties and to preserve whiteness.8 Zinc aluminate is normally synthesised via a solid-state reaction of zinc and aluminium oxides above 800 øC9,10 or via coprecipitation,7,12 hydrothermal 11 and sol-gel methods with several organic precursors.10,12?14 It could be used as a ceramic material similar to e.g. magnesium aluminate (MgAl2O4) and manganese?zinc ferrites [(Mn,Zn)Fe2O4].
