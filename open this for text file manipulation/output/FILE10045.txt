Moreover, the structurally relaxed amorphous alloy has nearly the same Young's modulus values as the partially crystallized alloy with about 74% crystals (Fig. 13), indicating that the precipitated crystalline phases may not have significantly higher Young's modulus than the structurally relaxed amorphous phase.
