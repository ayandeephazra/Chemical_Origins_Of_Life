This evidence is in good agreement with the fact that at a given x the mean atomic volume is larger in Sm-doped ceria than in Lu-doped ceria (see Fig. 5); moreover, the trends of both the lattice parameter and the mean atomic volume show a linear increase vs. the Sm content [10,12], so that the two aforementioned effects are not competing.
