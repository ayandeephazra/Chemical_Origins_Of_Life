Pending questions have been answered, relevant to (i) the SG of the saturated hydride as far as previous experimental works as well as theoretical computations could not rule out either two suggested symmetries, i.e. P63mc and P31c, (ii) the ground state of LaNi5 which was defined as paramagnetic by the experiment and ferromagnetic by theoretical computations and (iii) the interplay between the magnetovolume effects and the bonding of hydrogen in the host lattice.
