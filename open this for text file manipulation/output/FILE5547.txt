The isothermal Birch?Murnaghan equation of state, truncated to the second-order in energy [24], was used to fit the experimental P?V data within the P-range investigated (i.e., 0.0001?2.5(1)GPa), giving the following isothermal bulk modulus: K 0 = ? 0 ?1 = V 0(?P/?V)=18.0(1.1)GPa (? 0 =0.055(3)GPa?1), with V 0 =43,793(184)A?3.
