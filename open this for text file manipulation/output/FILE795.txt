To minimize possible damages of high ejection force to tablets and dies during large scale commercial manufacturing, two changes were made to arrive at Formulation B (Table 2), i.e., 1) increasing the amount of MgSt from 0.25 wt% to 0.75 wt% to reduce the ejection force; and 2) using more of the plastic MCC to replace some of the brittle mannitol to mitigate the lamination issue at high compaction pressures.
