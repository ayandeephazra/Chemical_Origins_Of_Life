Due to the difficulties associated with measuring the ISF energy at high temperature [20] and the lack of methodologies obtaining the unstable energies merely from experiments, first-principles calculations have become the primary tools to obtain GSFE and thus analyze the plastic deformation behaviors of metals and alloys [21?23].
