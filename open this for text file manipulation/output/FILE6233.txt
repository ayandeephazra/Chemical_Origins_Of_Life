MARE, which in this case comprises only lattice constants, monoclinic angle, and volume, under tensile strains varies from 1.28?1.41% for hybrids to 1.98?2.39% for pure DFT approaches, whereas under compressive strains the opposite is observed, since hybrids demonstrate values of 1.22?1.54% and pure DFT approaches improve to 0.82?0.95%.
