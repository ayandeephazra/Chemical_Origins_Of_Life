The internal energies for the high and low pressure phases of the nanocrystals are given by(4)Ulp(P,V)=TQlp-PVlp+?lpNlp-?lpAlpUhp(P,V)=TQhp-PVhp+?hpNlp-?hpAhpwhere U, Q, and ? are the bulk like internal energy, entropy and chemical potential terms, respectively, for each phase at low pressure (lp) and high pressure (hp).
