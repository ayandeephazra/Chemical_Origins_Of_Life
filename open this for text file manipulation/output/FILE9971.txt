This paper studies the crystallization behavior of the Zr57Cu20Al10Ni8Ti5 bulk amorphous alloy, the evolution mechanism of the nanocrystalline microstructures, the deformation behavior and mechanical properties of the amorphous and partially nanocrystallized alloy with different crystalline fractions.
