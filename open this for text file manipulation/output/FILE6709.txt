If isolated, very hydrous regions could exist at TZ depth that accommodate most of the strain, strong petrofabrics of hydrous phases such as phase D and/or ShyB could account for the deep shear wave anisotropy reported beneath the slab in southern Taiwan (Hu et al., 2012) and the seismic sub-slab scatterers observed below the Tonga slab (Kaneshima, 2013).
