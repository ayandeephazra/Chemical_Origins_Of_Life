From Fig. 8, we see the unit-cell volumes of the anhydrous pyrope are slightly smaller than hydrous pyrope in this study at low pressures, while their unit-cell volumes become very close to each other at higher pressures due to the larger compressibility (smaller bulk modulus) of the hydrous sample.
