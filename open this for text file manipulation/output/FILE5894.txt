The stability field of antigorite is also studied in the MgO?SiO2?H2O (MSH) and MgO?Al2O3?SiO2?H2O (MASH) systems (Ulmer and Trommsdorff, 1995; Wunder and Schreyer, 1997; Bromiley and Pawley, 2003; Komabayashi et al., 2005), while antigorite in the MASH system contains aluminum and is stable to higher temperatures and pressures than MSH compositions (Bromiley and Pawley, 2003).
