Sidorov found that single phase zinc aluminate powder calcined at 1250 øC did not sinter without additives like TiO2 up to 1650 øC.15 However, Hong et al. found that single phase powder calcined at 1300 øC did sinter, but reached at 1400 øC a maximum density of 80%.9 In this work, the zinc aluminate powder was calcined at 1000 øC, indicating that some zinc oxide is still present.
