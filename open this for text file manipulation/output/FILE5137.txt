For linear anisotropic elastic response, the strain energy potential is defined as the quadratic form in strain(2.17)W=12?:C(?,?úu):?.The tangent elasticity tensor depends on ? and possibly volume change:(2.18)CIJKL=CIJKL0[?+(1-?)(1-?)2]+k0?IJ?KL[1-?-(1-?)(1-?)2]?-?úu??.Here, ??[0,1) is a constant of usual magnitude much less than unity that is used to provide some residual elastic stiffness in damaged regions where ??1; increasing this parameter has been found to improve numerical stability in some cases.
