Moreover, the enthalpy of formation for Mo-Co system is smaller than that for Mo-Mn system, due to the large effect of SMe factor (i.e. Atom A is with the smaller number of valence electrons than atom B, which makes atom A tend to occupy large CN sites [21]) for Mo-Co system reduces the effect of LAs factor on atomic order.
