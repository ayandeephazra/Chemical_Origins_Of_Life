Therefore, the dual behavior observed in the trend of the cell volume can be considered as the result of the two described competing effects, with the contribution of vacancies dominating from x > ~0.2. Relying on a recent work of this research group [39], where a method based on Raman spectroscopy was proposed to evaluate the RE coordination number in doped ceria, x = 0.2 in the Lu-containing system roughly corresponds to Lu coordination number 7.5, which means that 75% of Lu atoms have coordination number 8 and 25% of them have coordination number 6.
