Combining the previous findings and including the results of this study on NaMnSi2O6, the study by Periotto et al. [12] on a NaInSi2O6 and the compression behaviour of NaAlSi2O6 [22] and NaGaSi2O6 (McCarthy et al. personal communication) (e.g. In, Al and Ga = non 3d-transition elements), we can definitively confirm that the ?Anderson?Anderson relationship? can be used for isostructural compounds, if aspects of isovalency of cations in more complex ionic compounds are considered.
