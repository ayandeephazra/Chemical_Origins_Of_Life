The coordination number of the A-site cation in ABC3 perovskite-structured compounds is seen to reduce on entering a hettotype phase from the aristotype, and in complex tilt systems, in addition to the A-site polyhedron and the B-site octahedron, there exists a substantial component of non-bonded void space.
