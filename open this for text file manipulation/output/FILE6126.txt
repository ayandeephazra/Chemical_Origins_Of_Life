For example, although one can find a variety of theoretical studies [2,8?11] based on conventional density functional theory (DFT) and beyond-DFT techniques in which the electronic structure of LaNiO3 is extensively investigated and compared to the experimental data, in the literature scarcely any first principles calculations on the elastic properties of LaNiO3 have been reported so far.
