The stability of a crystal in a loaded state against infinitesimal homogeneous deformations is determined by the Birch elastic constants c ?ijkl, which in the case of a cubic crystal are related to the Bragger elastic constants c ijkl by the relations [26].(1)c ?11=c11?p, c ?12=c12+p, c ?44=c44?p From here on the elastic constants are given in designations of Voigt.
