Stresses at each step were calculated using the virial atomic stress tensor, which has been shown to be equivalent to the continuum Cauchy stress [24] as per Eq. (3):(3)Sab=-?imiviavib+12?i?j=?iFijarijbwhere mi and vi are the mass and velocity of the atomi, Fij is the force between atomsi andj, rij is the distance between atomsi andj, and the indices a andb denote the Cartesian components.
