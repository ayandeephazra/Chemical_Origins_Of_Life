The results indicate that (i) the plot for molybdite is linear, and the bulk modulus measured directly exceeds the Rietveld ND results and (ii) the plot for calcite clear indications of ?plateuing? as pressure increases, i.e. non-linearity in the pressure?volume relationship, (iii) the molybdite bulk moduli from the ND Rietveld plots, while comparable with the ?directly measured? values, are both approximately 60% of the corresponding measured value, indicating some possible deficiency in the March model, and (iv) the calcite ND results agree closely with the directly measured value.
