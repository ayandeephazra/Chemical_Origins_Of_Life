Deviations can be likely explained by differences in the experimental approaches because all our measurements were conducted in platelet scattering geometry, which reduces the uncertainties associated to the refractive index of the sample and the internal scattering angle in the calculation of the phonon directions and acoustic velocities (Sinogeikin and Bass, 2000; Whitfield et al., 1976).
