The cB? model suggests the following: The defect Gibbs energy g i, where i refers to the operating process, i.e., i = f, m or act for the defect formation, migration and activation, respectively, can be expressed as: [20,29].(3)gi=ciB?where B is the isothermal bulk modulus of the matrix material, ? stands for the mean volume per atom and c i is approximately independent of temperature and pressure.
