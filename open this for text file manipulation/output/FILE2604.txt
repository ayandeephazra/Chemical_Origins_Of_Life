To understand the density profiles and mineralogical models of the upper mantle better, we also modeled the density profiles of the representative upper-mantle mineral assemblages-pyrolite, using the updated thermoelastic properties of hydrous pyrope for the Earth?s upper mantle region between 200 and 400km depth (Fig. 10 ).
