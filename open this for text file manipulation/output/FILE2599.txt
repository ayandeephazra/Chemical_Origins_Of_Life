Furthermore, the density profiles of olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene were also modeled using existing results on their thermoelasticity parameters (Suzuki and Anderson, 1983; Guyot et al., 1996; Zhao et al., 1995, 1998; Shinmei et al., 1999; Nishihara et al., 2003; Liu and Li, 2006; Lu et al., 2013; Huang and Chen, 2014).
