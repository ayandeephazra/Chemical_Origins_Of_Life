Phase equilibrium studies in hydrous peridotite have provided evidence for a series of dense hydrous magnesium silicate phases DHMS (phase A, E, superhydrous phase B and phase D), which are considered the major carriers of water in subduction zones (Iwamori, 2004; Kanzaki, 1991; Litasov and Ohtani, 2007; Ohtani et al., 2001; Poli and Schmidt, 2002; Schmidt and Poli, 1998).
