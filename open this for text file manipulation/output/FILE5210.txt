The following ratios of grain boundary to bulk surface energy and elastic shear stiffness are also defined, where the G subscript refers to a property value used for the isotropic grain boundary region:(3.1)R?=?G/?,R?=(?0)G/?0=(k0)G/k0.Effects of various prescriptions of residual elastic stiffness factor ? are also examined, where ??10-4 was found necessary for numerical stability.
