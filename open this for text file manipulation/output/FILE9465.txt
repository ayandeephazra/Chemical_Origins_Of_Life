Lattice parameters for representative crystals from each run (Table 1 ) were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction using eight-position centering of 15?20 low-angle reflections on either the Huber four-circle diffractometer in Bayreuth (samples WH833 and WH2120) or the Bruker P4 four-circle diffractometer in the Mineral Structures Laboratory at the University of Colorado (sample SS0401).
