The different curvature of these layers leads to different varieties, and the three structural varieties are: lizardite, which has a planar structure; chrysotile, which has cylindrically rolled layers; and antigorite, which has a unique wavelike structure along the a-axis because of the periodic reversals of the tetrahedral layer?s polarity every half wavelength.
