The calculated C P and previous experiemntal results [56-58] are shown in Fig. 12 b, C Pkeeps increasing even at high temperature due to the work done by the volumetric expansion, and the linear relation with temperature implies that the quasiharmonic approximation employed to compute thermal physical properties is reliable below 1500K for R2O3 phases.
