Although ShyB and phase D may coexists between 16GPa and 28 GPa in very hydrous systems (>3wt.% bulk water, (Komabayashi et al., 2005; Litasov et al., 2007)), it is reasonable to assume for the calculations that ShyB is the only stable DHMS phase in the TZ and ULM (Litasov et al., 2007) when the bulk water in the system is around 1wt.%.
