Concerns regarding the true space group of armstrongite were discussed by Karashaev and Sapozhnikov [2] and Jambor et al. [3]: on the basis of the reflection conditions (in particular h + k + l =? 2n, h0l with h + l =? 2n and 0k0 with k =? 2n), they reported the I-centered lattice with space group choices I2/m, I2 and Im.
