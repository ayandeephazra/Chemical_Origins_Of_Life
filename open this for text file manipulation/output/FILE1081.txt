In this work, through careful data acquisition and analysis, whereby non-hydrostatic data are identified and disregarded, the bulk modulus of GdBO3 was determined to be 170(13) GPa, which is in good agreement expected values based on compressibility systematics of orthoborates and with the predicted value of 135 GPa of Ref. [14], and is approximately 50% of the overestimated value of 326 GPa of Ref. [11], and of 321 of Ref. [12].
