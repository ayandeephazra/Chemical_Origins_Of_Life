Initially, all bulk Ni with system size (l), l = 6.66, 7.35, 8.03, 8.65 nm (corresponding with atoms number (N), N = 4000, 5324, 6912, and 8778 atom) lowered down temperature (T) from T = 2000K to T = 300 K to move material from the liquid state to the crystallization state with heating rate 4 ž 1012 K/s; Increase the heating rate from 4 ž 1012 K/s to 4 ž 1013 K/s, 4 ž 1014 K/s with material has l = 8.03 nm; Increase the temperature from T = 300 K to 500, 700, 800, 900, 1100 K with bulk Ni has system size l = 8.03 nm; Increase the tempering time (t) with material has l = 8.03 nm at crystallization temperature (Tg), Tg = 800 K after t = 0.0, 40, 80, 160ps (corresponding with 2 ž 104, 4 ž 104, 8 ž 104 step, where the time a step simulation MD is 2fs).
