This method has been successfully applied to many other systems [18?23], among which the blind prediction of high-pressure orthorhombic structure of FeTi3O7 [21], insulating Aba2-40 (or oC40) structure of dense Li [22?23], and two low-pressure monoclinic structures of Bi2Te3 have been confirmed by independent experiments [24].
