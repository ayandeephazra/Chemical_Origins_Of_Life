Within the current calculations, the VB configuration of the converged SP calculations for various atoms of LaNi5 is as follows:La:4f?0.244f?0.245d?0.955d?0.956s?0.276s?0.27Ni(2c):3d?4.273d?4.274s?0.324s?0.32Ni(3g):3d?4.253d?4.254s?0.344s?0.34It is clear from the outer electron configurations that the 6s bands of lanthanum as well as 4s nickel bands give away charges to the extent of ?1.5 and ?1.3 respectively.
