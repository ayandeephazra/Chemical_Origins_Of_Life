Assuming that VII>VI we get [15] (3)Nvd=VII?VIAs for, the quantity ?d in Eq. (2), it represents the compressibility ?d of the defect volume vd (4)?d=?1vddvddP|TThis differs in general from the compressibility ?I of the component I, i.e.,(5)?d?I(??)=?1A combination of Eqs. (2), (3) and (5) leads to(6)BBI=1+x?1+x??where the symbol ? stands for(7)??VIIVI?1>0Combining Eqs. (1) and (6) we find(8)BVBIVI=(1+x?)21+x??orB?BI?I=(1+x?)21+x??where the symbols ? and ?I denote the mean volume per atom of the mixed system and the ?pure? crystal I, respectively.
