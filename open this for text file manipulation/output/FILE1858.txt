In marked contrast to the well-studied compound RbCaF3, the structural phase transitions in KCaF3 have only been subject to limited investigation [6,7], presumably this is due to the relative simplicity of the near-tricritical transition in the former, and the complexities of the first order phase transitions in the latter.
