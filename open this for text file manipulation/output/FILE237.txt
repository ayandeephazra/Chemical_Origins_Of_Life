The experimental values for the defect volumes determined also in Ref. [58] are v f = (12.6?13.2) cm3/mole and v m = (3.2?4.0) cm3/mole for the cation vacancy migration process, thus the corresponding vigi values are(9)vfgf=5.9?6.2ž10?2GPa?1and(10)vmgm=4.6?5.8ž10?2GPa?1for these two defect processes, respectively.
