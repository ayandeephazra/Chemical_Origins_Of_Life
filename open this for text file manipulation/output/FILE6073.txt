The 8mR [100] undergoes an increase of ellipticity [here described as (O3?O3)Short/(O3?O3)Long, Fig. 3)] with P along with a general distortion (Fig. 6 and Table 6), as reflected by the shortening of the O3?O3Short, [O2?O2]8mR and O2?O3 and the stretching of the O3?O3Long diameters (Fig. 3; Table 6).
