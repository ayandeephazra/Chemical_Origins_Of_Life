Their result is potentially the product of problems either with their experimental data or the analysis thereof, however it is not possible to say based on the data they present, for example: not a single a XRD refinement is presented and only integrated patterns are provided; no details are provided of how the XRD fits were made; no details are provided of how the equations of state were fitted, such as the type or order; the XRD patterns exhibit gasket reflections from the very lowest pressure; and, the XRD reflections are broad/exhibit low-intensity at low pressures (compare for example to the data in Fig. 1).
