The surface energy as a function of temperature, T, and oxygen partial pressure, PO2, as(38)S?=12A(Etot,surf-NSn?SnO2,bulk)+NSn-NO2?O20(0K)+?HO2(T)-T?SO2(T)+kTlnPO2the temperature dependence of Etot,surf and ?SnO2 would essentially cancel out each other on computing the surface energy and thus, can be approximated by DFT calculations at 0K.
