From the calculated elastic constants, the macroscopic bulk modulus (B V) and shear modulus (G V) of mackinawite (FeS) were determined, using Eqs. (14) and (15), respectively, within the Voigt (V) approximation [42,54].(14)BV=2C11+2C12+C33+4C139 (15)GV=2C11+C33?C12?2C13+6C44+3C6615 For the pyrite (FeS2), the bulk modulus (B V) and shear modulus (G V) can be evaluated as follows:(16)BV=C11+2C123 (17)GV=C11?C12+3C445 The mechanical stability of Fe-S compounds is examined in terms of Eqs. (12) and (13).
