Accuracy at simulating bulk mechanical properties from uniaxial tension did not necessarily indicate accuracy when simulating nanowires.?Discrepancies in elastic modulus in previously reported studies appear to be caused by the use of potentials that were not suitable for nanowires at room temperature.?Both the Foiles 1986 and Olsson 2010 potential correctly predicted a trend of decreasing elastic modulus with increasing temperature and decreasing cross-sectional size.?The Olsson 2010 potential was the most accurate and was parameterized with bulk elastic constants, surface energies, and thermal expansion coefficients at a large range of temperatures.?While ReaxFF offers the ability to model bond formation and breaking, it was the least accurate of all potentials tested.
