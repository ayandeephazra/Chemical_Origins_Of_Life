Dollase [1] used a cylindrically symmetric version of an ellipsoidal model showed by March to describe the pole distribution in a powder sample(1)P(?)=[r2 cos 2 ?+r?1 sin 2 ?]?3/2,where ? is the angle between the preferred orientation (PO) direction and the reciprocal lattice vector direction for Bragg peak.
