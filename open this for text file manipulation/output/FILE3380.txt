For each experimental point, the absolute pressure (Table 2) was determined according to the equation(7)P=?V0VKT(V)VdV where the unit-cell volume (V) was determined by means of X-ray diffraction, and the isothermal bulk modulus KT was derived from the adiabatic bulk modulus KS calculated using Brillouin sound velocities, according to the following expression:(8)Ks=KT(1+??T) where ? is the volume thermal expansion and ? is the Gru?neisen parameter.
