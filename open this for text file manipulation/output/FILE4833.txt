The cohesive energies E coh are calculated using the following equation:(2)Ecoh=(Etot?nEatom)/n,where E tot and E atom are the total energy of the system for atoms in the primitive unit cell at equilibrium and an isolated (free) spin-polarized atom, respectively, and n is the number of atoms in the primitive unit cell.
