The thermoelectric efficiency of a material is determined by the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT), with ZT = (S 2 ?T/(? L + ? e)), where S is Seebeck coefficient, ? is the electrical conductivity, ? L is the lattice thermal, ? e is the electronic thermal conductivity, respectively, and T is the absolute temperature [19].
