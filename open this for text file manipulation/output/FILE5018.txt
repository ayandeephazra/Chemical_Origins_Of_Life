At the stability boundary of a cubic crystal.(2)KT=c ?11+2c ?123=0??=c ?11?c ?122=0?=c ?44=0 The first condition corresponds to the crystal loss of stability against the all-round stretching, the second and the third, respectively, against a tetragonal shear and a simple shear along one of the directions of symmetry with retention of the volume.
