Shear wave anisotropy observed in various subduction zones is likely related to the LPO of hydrous phases, especially in cold subduction zones where hydrous regions are plausible and slab lithologies are subjected to high non-hydrostatic stresses (Hu et al., 2012; Kaneshima, 2013; Mainprice and Ildefonse, 2009; Rosa et al., 2013a).
