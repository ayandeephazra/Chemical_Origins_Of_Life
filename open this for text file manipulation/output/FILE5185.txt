Upon application of each increment, a solution of the governing equations is found via conjugate gradient energy minimization, as discussed in Section 3.1. Each microstructure is seeded with an initial defect, specifically an edge crack, along the midplane (L/2) of one edge of the cube and oriented perpendicular to the direction of loading, as shown in Fig. 1(d).
