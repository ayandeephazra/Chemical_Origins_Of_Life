The relationship of the surface to volume ratio with the gas sensitivity is described as [850,868] (81)S?=?tkEth?0Cg?n0VmVs+1where ?t is a time constant, n 0 is the electron concentration of sensor at an operating temperature in the air atmosphere, k Eth is the reaction rate constant, C g is the gas concentration, ?0 is a number of oxygen ion per unit area, ? is a ratio of surface area per volume of material (V m) and V s is the system volume.
