For a stoichiometric SnO2 surface (N O =2N Sn), the surface energy must be independent of ?O2, while for a nonstoichiometric or defective surface (N O =?2N Sn), the surface energy becomes a linear function of ?O2 with a positive slope for the oxygen deficient case, or a negative slope for the oxygen-enriched case.
