Moreover elastic moduli measurements have also been performed at high pressure and room temperature, using ultrasonic techniques on polycrystalline aggregates (Rigden et al., 1994; Gwanmesia et al., 1998; Chen et al., 1999; Wang and Ji, 2001) and through the use of Brillouin spectroscopy on both single crystals (Conrad et al., 1999; Sinogeikin and Bass, 2000; Murakami et al., 2008) and powdered samples (Sinogeikin and Bass, 2002).
