We finally discuss the point that the present findings are strikingly reminiscent of the following case: the cB? model was found [45] to describe the formation volume of Schottky defects in a certain class of high-T c superconductors and in addition plays a decisive role towards understanding the trend of melting temperatures for the RB?2Cu3O7? ? (R-123, R=yttrium and lanthanides) cuprate high-T c superconductors [46].
