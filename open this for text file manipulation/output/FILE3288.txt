While the value of the bulk and shear moduli, Ks and G, reported by these studies cover a relatively small range, the exact dependence particularly of Ks on Mj content is unclear, large discrepancies in elastic moduli pressure derivatives exist, the thermal properties are poorly constrained as is the effect of the Alm content.
