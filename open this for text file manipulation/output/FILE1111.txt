There are three important remarks: firstly that the alleged GdBO3 bulk modulus of 326 GPa is not compatible with their data; secondly, that in any case such a large bulk modulus is not compatible with the known compressibility systematics of isomorphic borates [26]; and thirdly, that the low bulk modulus of 95(13) GPa re-fitted here drastically underestimates the bulk modulus of GdBO3.
