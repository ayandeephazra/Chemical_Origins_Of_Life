A powder-diffraction profile suitable for Rietveld refinement was obtained after electronically focusing the 702 individual detector element spectra from the nine modules of the 90ø bank, normalization of the summed pattern with respect to the incident beam monitor and the scattering from a standard vanadium sample and, finally, a correction for the wavelength and scattering-angle dependence of the neutron attenuation by the anvil and gasket materials [30].
