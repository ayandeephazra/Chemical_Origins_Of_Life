The long ?free diameters? of the channel systems make this zeolite a good candidate to explore the P-induced penetration of external molecular species in response to hydrostatic compression, generating the so called ?hyper-confinement regime?: the behavior of a host?guest system in response to the combined effect of applied pressure, spatial confinement and morphological constraints at the sub-nanoscale (e.g., [12?14]).
