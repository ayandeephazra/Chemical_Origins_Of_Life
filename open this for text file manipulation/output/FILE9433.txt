Hydration is expected to alter the thickness and depth of the olivine to wadsleyite phase transition (e.g., (Wood, 1995; Chen et al., 2002; Smyth and Frost, 2002)), promote partial melting (Hirschmann, 2006), and alter rheological and transport properties (Chen et al., 1998; Huang et al., 2005; Karato, 2006).
