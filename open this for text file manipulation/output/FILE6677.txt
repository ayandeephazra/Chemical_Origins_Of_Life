The compressional (A P) and the shear (A S) wave velocity anisotropy of ShyB up to high pressure were determined using the relationship:(2)Ai=200?(Vi,max-Vi,min)(Vi,max+Vi,min)where the terms (Vi ,max ? Vi ,min) and (Vi ,max + Vi ,min) respectively correspond to the difference and the sum between the maximum and minimum of the acoustic velocities (i =P or S) of ShyB.
