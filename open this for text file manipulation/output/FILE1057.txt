That is, the M's with exothermic formation energy for MO, such as NiO, RhO and IrO, exhibit strong hybridization of their d density of states with the Fe d density of states while the M's with endothermic formation energy for MO, such as MgO, YO and ZrO, exhibit weak overlap with the Fe density of states.
