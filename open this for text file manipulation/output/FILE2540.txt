Lu et al. (2013) measured the single-crystal elasticity of natural Fe-bearing pyrope using in situ Brillouin spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction at high-pressure and temperature conditions up to 20GPa and 750K in an externally-heated diamond anvil cell, and found (?K 0/?T)P =?0.023(2)GPaK?1 for Fe-bearing pyrope, which is very consistent with the results from Wang et al. (1998) ((?K 0/?T)P =?0.020(3)GPaK?1) and Zou et al. (2012) ((?K 0/?T)P =?0.021(9)GPaK?1) for pure pyrope using a synchrotron X-ray diffraction method within their uncertainties.
