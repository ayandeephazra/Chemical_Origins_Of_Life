Imposing the variational principle(2.6)??=???(tú?u+s??)dS,and assuming fields are sufficiently smooth, the following local equilibrium equations in ? and boundary conditions on ?? are derived, following general methods outlined for example in [19,40]:(2.7)?ú?W??u?=?úP=0; (2.8)?g??-2?ú(???)+?W???u=0; (2.9)t=Pún,s=2?:(???n).The traction vector (mechanical force per unit area) on ?? is t; the scalar conjugate force to order parameter ? on ?? is s; the outward unit normal vector to ?? is n.
