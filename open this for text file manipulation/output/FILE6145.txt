A variety of DFT approaches was tested in order to find out which of them exhibit the closest resemblance to the low-temperature experimental data on crystalline structure: starting from standard local density (LDA [23,24]) and generalized gradient (PBE [25]) approximations up to revised functionals for solids (PBEsol [26], SOGGA [27], and WC [28]) and hybrids (mB1WC, PBE0 [29], and HSE06 [30]).
