The large degree of inversion in the sol-gel prepared zinc aluminate cannot be attributed to the presence of aluminium cations with four or five oxygen atom surroundings at the surface, as zinc aluminate prepared via the sol-gel route has a large surface area.35 The NMR experiments were performed in a quantitative manner, revealing that all aluminium cations are detected and that shielding of the bulk cations did not occur.
