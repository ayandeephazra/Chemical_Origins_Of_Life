However, the chemical potential of the component in the metal-alloy catalyst becomes high as the size of the catalyst decreases due to the Gibbs?Thomson effect(42)??=2S?rwhere ?? is the chemical potential difference of the component species in the liquid droplet, S ? is the surface energy and r is the radius of the curvature of the droplet.
