For example, for the Morse potentials based on sublimation/cohesive energy or bulk modulus of fcc Cu, agreement between the experimental g(r) values at 1150øC and those given by the Monte Carlo simulation can be achieved only if the simulation is carried out at a very high temperature, in excess of 2000øC.
