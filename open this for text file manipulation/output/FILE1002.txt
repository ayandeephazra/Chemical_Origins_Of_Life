Thus the formation energy of HeO do not correspond to a single He4O4 entity embedded in the iron matrix rather corresponds to separate He and O atoms dissolved in the iron matrix which is endothermic perhaps because He assume apparently large size (as evident from the He-He bond length in iron matrix) which cause tensile stress on the matrix leading to increase in the total energy of Fe124He4O4.
