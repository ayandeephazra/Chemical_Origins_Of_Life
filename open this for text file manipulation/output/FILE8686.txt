The bulk moduli obtained from c ij's are larger than the ones from EoS fittings by 5?9%, since (i) all the freedoms of crystal are allowed to relax in the EoS fittings, while the cell shape is fixed in the determination of c ij's and (ii) the data of energy vs volume used in the EoS fittings are not in the complete elastic region, unlike the determinations of c ij's [19].
