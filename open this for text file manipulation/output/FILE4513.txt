Similarly to what was observed in this work, even in Gd-doped ceria the bulk modulus shows a linear decrease with increasing the Gd amount, which can be explained analogously to Sm-doped ceria (see Fig. 5); this behaviour is essentially different from the one of other moduli, such as the Young's and shear modulus, which display data lying above the linear fit observed up to x = 0.2, and consequently point at a stiffening of the structure at higher x [29].
