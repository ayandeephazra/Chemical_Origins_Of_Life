In order to study the effect of the anisotropy degree as well as the number and size of grains on mechanical properties of polycrystalline material, six metals of hcp lattice symmetry with seven grain sizes each were considered in this work, see the following enumeration I?VI, Tables B.5?B.15 and Fig. 2 .
