Xu et al. [200] conducted first principle calculation of electronic properties of FTO with 4.16 at.% of F, which was further extended by Velikokhatnyi et al. [293], where a systematic approach was employed to study the electronic structure of FTO over a range of F concentration varying from 0 to 66.6%.
