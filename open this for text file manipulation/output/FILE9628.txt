Thus, they [9] modified the diffusional driving force as(3)Fr=2CkBT/r,where C is a characteristic constant which takes care of not only Coulombian attractive force between the two particles (cation and anion) of the alkali halide under study, but also finite repulsive and van der Waals forces between them.
