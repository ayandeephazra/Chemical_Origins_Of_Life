When this constraint is active, the incremental energy minimization problem can be viewed as minimization of energy of an alternative system with time dependent boundary conditions associated with introduction of new (free) surfaces along which ??0.9 is prescribed; equilibrium Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) remain satisfied in solutions thus obtained for this alternative system.
