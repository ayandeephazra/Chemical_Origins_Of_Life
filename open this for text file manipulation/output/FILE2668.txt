Here, the electronic excitation energy E el (V, T) and electronic entropy S el (V, T) can be calculated by(4)Eel(V,T)=?0?n(?,V)f(?)?d???0?Fn(?,V)?d? (5)Sel(V,T)=?kB?0?n(?,V)[f(?)lnf(?)+(1?f(?))ln(1?f(?))]d?where n (?, V) is the electronic density of states (DOSs) at energy ? and volume V, f (?) is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function of electrons, ? F is the Fermi level, and k B is the Boltzmann's constant.
