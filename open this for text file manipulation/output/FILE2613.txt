From Fig. 10, the pyrolite model with all Fe-bearing minerals shows the largest density profile; whereas using the hydrous pyrope instead of the anhydrous Fe-bearing pyrope meant the modeled pyrolite with hydrous pyrope and other Fe-bearing minerals showed a lower density profile than the pyrolite model with all Fe-bearing minerals towards the PREM density profile (Fig. 10).
