We consider a mixed system AxBy ? xC1? y where the three end members A, B, C will be equivalently labeled as the pure components (1), (2) and (3), respectively, with volumes ? 1, ? 2 and ? 3 per ?molecule? and hence have molar volumes, V 1=N? 1, V 2=N? 2 and V 3=N? 3, where N stands for Avogadro's number.
