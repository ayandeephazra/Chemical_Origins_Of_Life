It also enables the explanation that the enthalpy h i scales with the melting temperature [35] and in addition allows the description of complex cases like the indenter penetration into a (ionic) crystal surface [36] (during which electric signals are emitted in a similar fashion as the electric signals measured before earthquakes [37?39]).
