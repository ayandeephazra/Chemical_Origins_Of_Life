The main focus of Woz?ny et al. in Ref. [11] is the high-pressure luminescence properties of GdBO3:Eu3+, however, Section 3.2 of the paper discusses the high-pressure structural properties of GdBO3:Eu3+, in particular the bulk modulus, which they allege to be 326 GPa, and which they state contradicts the ab initio calculations of Errandonea et al. [14] and supports the findings of Wang et al. [12].
