The elastic properties of U3Si2 were measured by Carvajal-Nunez et al. [19,20], but there is only a scant dataset including the Young's modulus (E = 130.4 ñ 0.5 GPa) and bulk modulus (K = 68.3 ñ 0.5 GPa) from resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) [19], and E = 153 ñ 2 GPa from nanoindentation (which also yielded a microhardness of 4.5 GPa) [20].
