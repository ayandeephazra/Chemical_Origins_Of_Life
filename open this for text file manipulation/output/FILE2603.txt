Based on the phase diagram of Opx (Woodland, 1998), we assume that the Opx phase (Pbca) transitions into the HP-Cpx phase (C2/c) at 250km (?8GPa) and is accompanied by a density jump, where the density profile of pure Opx is ?1.5% lower than the PREM density profile at depths up 250km, whereas the density profile of pure Opx is ?1.5% higher than the PREM density profile at depths under 250km.
