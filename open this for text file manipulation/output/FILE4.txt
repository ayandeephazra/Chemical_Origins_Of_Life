An impact of the atom arrangements at the nanoscale on the effective properties of such materials has been studied mainly by means of atomistic simulations (Hahn & Meyers, 2015), although some experimental data, in majority related to fcc materials, can be also found in the literature, e.g. Legros, Elliott, Rittner, Weertman, and Hemker (2000), Sharma and Ganti (2003).
