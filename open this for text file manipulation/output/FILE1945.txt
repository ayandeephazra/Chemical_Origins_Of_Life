The Ca - F1(1) compressibility at 3.5 GPa (? = 3.4 ž 10?3 GPa?1) is intermediate in value to that observed for the two symmetry independent CaF2 bonds (CaF2(1) ? = 5.2 ž 10?3 GPa?1; CaF2(4) ? = 2.7 ž 10?3 GPa?1), with the range in values encompassing the CaF bond compressibilities observed in the high pressure study of RbCaF3 [24].
