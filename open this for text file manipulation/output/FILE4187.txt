Tilting of the Zr-octahedra is the common deformation mechanism between elpidite and armstrongite (either at high temperature and high pressure [8, 22 and this paper]), whereas the role played by Ca (or Na) appears to be only secondary in armstrongite at high pressure but it is critical in elpidite at HP and in armstrongite at HT [8,22].
