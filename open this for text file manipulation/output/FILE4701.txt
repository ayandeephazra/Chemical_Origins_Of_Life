For the chemical bond in a fictitious binary crystal, the fractions of ionicity fi? and of covalence fc? can be evaluated from the average band gap Eg? as well as its heteropolar part C? and homopolar part Eh? [26?32]:(3)fi?=C?Eg?2fc?=Eh?Eg?2 (4)Eg?2=(C?)2+(Eh?)2 (5)Eh?=39.74(d?)-2.48 (6)C?=14.4b?exp-ks?r0?ZA?-nmZB?1r0?n?mC?=14.4b?exp-ks?r0?mnZA?-ZB?1r0?m?nwhere d?=2r0? is the bond length of a chemical bond, in A?, exp(-ks?r0?) is the Thomas?Fermi screening factor.
