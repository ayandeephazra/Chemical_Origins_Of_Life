In this paper, the following linear relationship for the variation of isothermal bulk modulus KT with temperature T is taken:(8)KT=KT0[1-?0?0(T-T0)],where ?0, KT 0, and ?0 are, respectively, the isothermal Anderson?Gruneisen parameter, the isothermal bulk modulus, and the thermal expansivity all at room temperature T0=300K and zero pressure.
