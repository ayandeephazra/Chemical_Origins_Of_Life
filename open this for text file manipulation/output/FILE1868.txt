For example, KZnF3, KCaF3, and NaMgF3 have been used in studies of the viscosity and electrical conductivity of the mantle [18?20], whilst the seismic velocity changes observed in the D?? region of the lower mantle have been interpreted by reference to experimental studies of NaNiF3, and NaMgF3 [21,22].
