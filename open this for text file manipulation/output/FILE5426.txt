As the modulus of the material decreases the film volume elastic energy decreases and misfit dislocation formation decreases.(4)Film volume elastic energy=Young'smodulus*film thickness*coherency strain As bulk modulus of the material decreases (increasing elasticity of the material) a larger strain can be accommodated in the lattice (before misfit dislocation generation) causing enhanced lattice expansion and faster ionic transport through the lattice.
