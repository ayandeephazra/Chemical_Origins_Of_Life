Thirdly, the shear modulus of 5d Hex-II-WB4 and Hex-II-ReB4 within shear plane (12 ?12) increasing with the shear stress direction rotating from [101 ?0] to [1 ?21 ?1] directions, while on the contrary it decreasing with the shear stress direction rotating from [101 ?0] to [1 ?21 ?1] directions for the 4d Hex-II-MoB4 and Hex-II-TcB4.
