This led to the conclusion that, when molecules in crystals are highly cross-linked through hydrogen bonds exhibiting mechanically interlocked structures with similar interactions in all directions, as in the APIs studied, deformational characteristics determined at the single-crystal level can be used as a good indicator of bulk deformational properties.
