Normally, the ethanol vapor is adsorbed on the surface of thermally activated SnO2 as [850] (76)O2(gas)+e-?O2-(adsorb)the oxygen molecules are dissociated into oxygen ion with singly or doubly negative electric charges by attracting an electron from the conduction band of SnO2 as(77)12O2+e-?koxyOads- (78)12O2+2e-?koxyOads2-The oxygen ions on the surface of SnO2 are active with the ethanol molecule and give up the electrons from the surface back to the conduction band of SnO2 semiconductor.
