We note here that Erhart has studied the energetics of helium atoms at the oxide-iron interfaces, considering various oxides (Al2O3, TiO2, Y2O3, YAlO3, Y3Al5O12, Y4Al2O9, MgO, CaO, BaO, SrO) to identify better oxides to make swelling resistant ODS steels for application in the fusion environments [12].
