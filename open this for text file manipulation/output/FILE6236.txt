Since simply reproducing the correct ground-state crystalline structure is not a sufficient criterion to properly evaluate the quality of the DFT approach performance [2], in Fig. 3 we also compare the density of states (DOS) obtained using the selected revised and hybrid functionals with experimentally observed spectrum of rhombohedral LaNiO3.
