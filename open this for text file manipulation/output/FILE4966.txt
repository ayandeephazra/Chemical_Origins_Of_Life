5 wt.% CO2 (10 wt.% MgCO3 in eclogite and 10 wt.% in peridotite) content in the form of magnesite was used in the compositional modeling as a carbonated eclogite and peridotite in order to better understand the sensitivity of the carbonation effects, although these rock assemblages are expected to contain much less CO2 (Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2010).
