We note that standard propagations of the errors involved in these calculations show that the standard deviation (ñ?) in the VP and VS values is approximately 2% (Fig. 9), meaning that these changes in the VP and VS profiles are all within the uncertainty and can be considered as negligible from a mineral physics prospective.
