These geophysical anomalies are predominantly observed in the vicinity of subducted slabs supporting the transport of hydrated slab material into the TZ, where the water liberated from the slab can be ultimately stored over geological time due to the large water storage capacities of the major constituents, wadsleyite and ringwoodite (Karato et al., 2013).
