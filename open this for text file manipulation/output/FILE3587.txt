Regarding bct-Sn in Fig. 6 (b) during the temperature ranging from 0 K to 500 K of the transformation point (bct?liquid), and hcp-Zr in Fig. 6 (c) during the temperature ranging from 0 K to 1000 K of the transformation point (hcp?bcc), a good agreement is observed between the present predictions and the SGTE data, with the exception of Cp at high temperatures.
