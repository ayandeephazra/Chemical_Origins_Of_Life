The time-of-flight data were electronically focussed, normalized to the incident flux distribution using an incident beam monitor, corrected for detector efficiency and solid angle using a vanadium standard, and finally corrected for self-shielding, and wavelength-dependent absorption (measured number density = 5.77 ž 1021 cm?3, ?s = 16.8 b, ?a = 2.6 b at ? = 1.798 A?).
