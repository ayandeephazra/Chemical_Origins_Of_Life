The Debye temperature ? reflects the thermodynamic properties of a solid and can be estimated by the following equation based on evaluation of the elastic constants [19]:(18)?=?k[3n4?(NA?M)]13vm,where h represents Planck's constant, and N A and M are the Avogadro number and the molecular weight, respectively.
