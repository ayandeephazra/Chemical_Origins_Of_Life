Substituting from (2.12), the Euler?Lagrange equation for order parameter equilibrium in (2.8) becomes(2.14)?=2?0[?2?+?(?2?-M?M:???)]-2B?.Note that in the present variational approach, time t does not enter the governing equations and can be regarded as a simple load parameter in the context of incrementally updated boundary conditions, for example.
