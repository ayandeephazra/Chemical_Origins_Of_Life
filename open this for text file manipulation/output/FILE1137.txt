The clear discontinuity in the rate of change of FWHM at 6.5 GPa for YBO3 and 9 GPa for GdBO3 indicate the loss of quasihydrostaticity and all data above these pressures have been omitted from further analysis, although they are still included in Fig. 2(a) to illustrate that the onset of non-hydrostaticity is also observed in the calculated unit cell volumes as a function of pressure.
