Mackinawite (FeS) and pyrite (FeS2) have recently attracted significant attention owing to their low cost, natural abundance, and unique and interesting electronic, elastic and thermodynamic properties, which make them strong candidate materials in technological applications such as solar cells [6,7], solid-state batteries [8,9], wastewater treatment [10] and as heterogeneous catalyst materials [11?13].
