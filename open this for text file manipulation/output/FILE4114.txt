Armstrongite, ideally CaZr [Si6O15]ú3H2O, is a rare mineral discovered for the first time in granite pegmatites and alkine granites of the Khan Bogdo massif (Mongolia) and described by Vladykin et al. [1], who indicated as possible space group Cm, C2 and C2/m and assigned to armstrongite the ideal formula CaZr [Si6O15]ú2.5H2O.
