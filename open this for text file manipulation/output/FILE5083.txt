Other two-dimensional computational approaches applied towards modeling polycrystalline deformation and fracture include the extended finite element method (XFEM) [12] and the cohesive boundary element method [13]; in three dimensions, continuum viscoplastic modeling of grain boundary phases of finite thickness has also been undertaken [14].
