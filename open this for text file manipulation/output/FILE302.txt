Fig. 6 shows the unit cell volumes of U3Si5 as a function of pressure, which are fitted using the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (BM-EOS) [41]:(2)P(V)=3K02[(V0V)73?(V0V)53]{1+34(K0??4)[(V0V)23?1]}where V 0 is the zero-pressure cell volume, V is the unit cell volume at high pressure, K 0 is the bulk modulus, and K? 0 is the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus.
