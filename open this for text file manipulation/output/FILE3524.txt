Helmholtz energy, F, for a phase of interest, at volume V and temperature T is given by Refs. [30,31],(1)F(V,T)=E0(V)+Fel(V,T)+Fvib(V,T)where the first term E 0 is the static energy at 0 K without the zero-point vibrational energy (ZPE), and is determined by fitting the first-principles energy vs. volume (E-V) data points according to a four-parameter Birch-Murnaghan equation of state (EOS) [32?34]:(2)E(V)=E0+9V0B016{[(V0V)23?1]3B0?+[(V0V)23?1]2[6?4(V0V)23]}where V 0 (volume), E 0 (energy), B 0 (bulk modulus) and B? (its pressure derivative) at 0 K are fitting parameters and ten E-V data points in the volume range from 0.9 V 0 to 1.1 V 0 are used for EOS fitting.
