The corresponding mechanical stability criteria for the cubic crystals of pyrite (FeS2) must satisfy the Eq. (13) [53]:(13)C11?C12>0;C11>0;C44>0;C11+2C12>0 The calculated results indicated that pyrite (FeS2) is more resistant to unidirectional compression than to sheared formation, because, the value of C 11 (399.21GPa) is large with respect to that of C 12 (32.58GPa) and C 44 (104.66GPa).
