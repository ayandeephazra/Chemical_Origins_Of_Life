The thermal diffusivity (a) of sintered zinc aluminate ceramics has been determined using the flash method on three 1.4 mm thick tablets with a density of 74, 91 and 94% (T sinter=1250, 1400 and 1600 øC, respectively) using the flash method36,37 at different temperatures between room temperature and 250 øC.
