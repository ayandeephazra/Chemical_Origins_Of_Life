The third term F vib(V,T) in Eq. (1) is the vibrational contribution to F, which can be determined from phonon DOS (PhDOS) (at least 5 vol used herein) and can be represented via [31]:(5)FvibV,T=kBT?0?ln2sinh??2kB?g?d?where k B is the Boltzmann constant, ? the Planck constant, and g(w) the PhDOS as a function of phonon frequency.
