Through the DFT and optical band gap, we obtained the band gap values in the 1.61?2.75 eV range, so the values between 1.61 and 1.84 eV are suitable for photovoltaic cell applications, while the highest values are suitable to absorb a tail of the visible light spectrum so it can be a top layer of the tandem solar cell [51?53].
