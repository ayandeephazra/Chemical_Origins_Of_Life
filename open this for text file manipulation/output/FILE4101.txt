This isothermal equation of state allows to obtain the isothermal bulk modulus of a given material K 0 [K 0 = ?V ú (?P / ?V)P0, which is the reciprocal of the thermodynamic volume compressibility coefficient ?0 = 1 / K 0 = ?1 / V ú (?V / ?P)P0], and its P-derivatives (K? = ?K 0 / ?P, K?? = ?2 K 0 / ?P 2).
