An analytical approximation for the flexural frequency in the longitudinal direction can be estimated using beam theory per the following equation.(2)f=((2n+1)?/2)2EIA?L4,where n is the critical frequency number (1 for first flexural frequency), E is the modulus of elasticity (Pa), I is the area moment of inertia (m4), A is the cross-sectional area (m2), ? is the density (kg/m3), and L is the plate length (m).
