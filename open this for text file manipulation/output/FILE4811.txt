In the present work, we have investigated structural properties (lattice constants, bulk moduli, and cohesive energies) at equilibrium for bulk solids with body centered cubic (BCC), face centered cubic (FCC), and diamond (DIA) structures, to assess the performance of various vdW functionals based on the DFT.
