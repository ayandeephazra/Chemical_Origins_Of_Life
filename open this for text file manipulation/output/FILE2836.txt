Lastly, the Young's Modulus E and Poisson's ratio ? at ambient condition were evaluated with an isotropic approximation via the following equations (2) and (3) to be 167.72 GPa and 0.24, respectively:(3)E=9GK0G+3K0 (4)?=3K0?2G2(G+3K0) The E value from this work is in excellent agreement with that calculated from DFT, 163.06 GPa [5], which is closer to 153 GPa (nanoindentation) [20], but larger than 130.4 GPa (RUS) [19] by ?27%.
