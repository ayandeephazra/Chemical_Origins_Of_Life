Although no amorphization was observed up to 4.3GPa, a progressive decrease with P of the intensity of reflections along with an increase of their full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), leading to a slight scattering of the unit-cell parameters trend at P ?4.0GPa (Fig. 5, Tables 3 and 4), suggest a lack of the long-range order in response to the applied pressure.
