In this case (i.e. provided that ?V/V =0), considering only the first terms of the corresponding expansions, the expressions for the elastic moduli become:(2)G=?+?4?tI2, (3)CL=?+2?+?2+43?3+2?4?lI2,where ?t ?1.38 and ?l ?1.54 are the averaged dipole form factors for the shear and longitudinal deformations, respectively (see Ref. [13] for details).
