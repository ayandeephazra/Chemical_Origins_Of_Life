The cationic ratio was set at the values found as previously described and not allowed to vary; in the last refinement cycle, structural parameters (lattice parameters, and in the C phase the Ce/Lu x coordinate and the O x, y and z coordinates), atomic Biso, the scale factor, five peak parameters, two asymmetry parameters and the background points, were refined.
