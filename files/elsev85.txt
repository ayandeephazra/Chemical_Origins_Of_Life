Objective This study evaluated physical and mechanical properties and characterized the filler particles of seven composites.
Materials and methods Filtek Supreme (FS, 3M Oral Care), Forma (FO, Ultradent), Charisma Diamond (CD, Kulzer), Spectra Smart (SS, Dentsply), Filtek Bulk Fill (FB, 3M Oral Care), Tetric N-Ceram Bulk Fill (TB, Ivoclar), and Cention N (Ivoclar) in self- (CNSC) or dual-curing (CNDC) were evaluated.
Fillers size, shape, and content were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray dispersive energy spectroscopy (EDX).
Disk-shaped specimens (n = 5) were prepared for sorption (SP) and solubility (SL).
Flexural strength and elastic modulus were tested at 24 h and 12 months (n = 10).
Degree of conversion (DC%) and maximum rate of polymerization (Rpmax) were evaluated using micro-Raman spectroscopy.
SP and SL results were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and Dunn's pairwise test (α = 0.05).
Mechanical properties were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05).
DC% of CNSC and CNDC was compared by independent t-test (α = 0.05).
Rpmax results were analyzed by 1-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (α = 0.05).
Results The composites differed regarding filler size, shape, and content.
CD and CNSC showed lower SP than FS.
SS had lower SL than CNSC and CNDC.
CNDC presented higher DC% than CNSC.
CD, TB, and CNDC showed the highest Rpmax.
TB, CNSC, and CNDC showed the lowest 24-h flexural strengths.
Mechanical properties of CD did not decrease, while FO, TB, and CNSC showed a significant reduction after storage.
Conclusions Monomer composition and fillers characteristics greatly influenced the physico-mechanical properties of the tested composites.
