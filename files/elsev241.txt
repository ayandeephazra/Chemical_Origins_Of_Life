In the present study, a thermodynamic model is formulated to determine the melting temperature of metals with increasing pressure using an equation of state (EoS).
The model is applied to determine the melting temperature of Cu, Au, Ag, Zn, Cd, In and Pb at high pressure.
The model formulation is based on Goyal and Gupta EoS which follows Stacey's criteria and is valid in high pressure conditions and also it does not involve any adjustable parameter.
The volume compression, bulk modulus and its first order pressure derivative is determined using the EoS with an increase in pressure.
It is observed that melting temperature show increase with the increase in pressure, however, variation is not linear.
The comparison of present computed results of melting temperature under pressure is done with the theoretical and experimental results available and good consistency between the compared results is observed.
This study helps in understanding the quantitative effect of pressure on the melting behavior of metals.
The melting temperature at high pressures can also be predicted using the present formalism.
