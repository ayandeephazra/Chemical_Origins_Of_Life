We explore relationships among bulk modulus, crack density, and permeability through repetitive loading of Marcellus shale.
Cumulative cyclic stressing (22â€“26 MPa with confinement of 24 MPa) is applied at a frequency of 0.05 Hz over 100,000 cycles.
Changes in acoustic velocities are used to follow changes in dynamic bulk modulus, Poisson ratio, and crack density and to correlate these with bedding-parallel measurements of methane permeability.
The shale is represented as an orthotropic elastic medium containing a dominant, noninteracting fracture set separated by thin laminae.
An effective continuum model links permeability evolution to the evolution of the bulk modulus and crack density.
Bulk modulus is linearly related to crack density by a scaling parameter representing rock fabric and fracture geometry.
The Poisson ratio and bulk modulus of the intact, uncracked shale are approximated from our data.
We propose a method for tracking permeability evolution of finely laminated shales using acoustic waves.
