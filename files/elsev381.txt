Elastic modulus is one of the key elemental material parameters.
Its variation with temperature has long been concerned by researchers.
In this study, a new temperature-dependent elastic modulus model without phenomenological fitting parameters for metallic bulk materials is developed.
The model is capable of predicting the Young's modulus, elastic constant, and shear modulus at different temperatures.
Good agreement is obtained between values predicted by the model and available experimental data of body-centered-cubic metals, faced-centered-cubic metals, wrought superalloys, and cast superalloys.
The inherent relationships between temperature-dependent elastic modulus, coefficient of expansion, heat capacity (or Debye temperature), and melting point of metallic materials are uncovered by the model.
Additionally, the model also provides a new method to predict elastic moduli: the elastic moduli at extremely high and low temperatures, which are difficult to obtain through experiments, can be predicted by the model with reference of an easy-to-access elastic modulus.
