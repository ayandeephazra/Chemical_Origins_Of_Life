We have analyzed in the two different models of volume dependence of Grüneisen parameter (γ).
The initial Grüneisen parameter γ0 and its logarithmic volume derivatives so called the third order Grüneisen parameter (λ) are obtained from the fitting of experimental data in ε-Fe, NaCl, K, Li, and Na solids.
We also determined the second order Grüneisen parameter ( q 0 ) using the initial and third order Grüneisen parameters.
The calculated results of γ 0 are in good agreement with the experimental data for the case of different solids.
The results of q 0 parameter are compared with the other methods of calculation.
A comparison result of the two parameters q 0 and λ based on the two models has been presented for the different solids.
