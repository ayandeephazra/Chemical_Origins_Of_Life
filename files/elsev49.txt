Selective laser melting (SLM) is a promising powder bed based additive manufacturing technique for the near-net-shape production of large-scale bulk metallic glasses (i.e. 3D-printed BMGs).
Initial defects such as pores inherent to the SLM process are regarded as key factors for the mechanical integrity of BMGs.
Here the structural defects in the form of pores are controlled in the SLM-processing of large-scale and fully-amorphous Zr-based BMGs.
Their effects on the tensile fracture behaviors are revealed by experimental and computational studies.
Under uniaxial tension, 3D-printed BMGs fracture in a brittle mode with almost zero macroscopic plasticity.
The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) exhibits a rapid linear decrease with increasing porosity, while the Young's modulus is found to be insensitive in the low-porosity ( < 2 % ) regime but decreases quickly in the high-porosity regime.
Finite element (FE) simulations show different deformation mechanisms for pore-free and pore-containing BMGs.
The former fractures with abundant homogeneously distributed shear bands initiated from material inherent weak points, while the latter experiences firstly plastic deformation around some pores with shear transformation zones (STZs).
These STZs connect with each other as the load increases, forming a small number of highly localized shear bands, which develop into the final fracture surface.
The orientation of the fracture surface in 3D-printed BMGs tends to show a larger angle than that of most as-cast Zr-based BMGs under tension (e.g. 50 âˆ˜ ) and is predominantly affected by pore structures.
The experimental and computational results imply that the printing defects play a dominant role in shear band formation and corresponding mechanical properties for 3D-printed BMGs.
