A curve-fit with a truncated third-order Birch–Murnaghan equation of state with a fixed K'o = 4 to pressure-normalized volume data yielded the isothermal bulk modulus, Ko = 43 ± 4 GPa, indicating that basic sodalite is more compressible than sodalite, possibly due to a difference in interactions between the framework host and the guest molecules.
