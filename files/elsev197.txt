High pressure experiments using diamond anvil cells with a quasi-hydrostatic pressure transmitting medium (helium or neon) and coupled with X-ray diffraction have very recently been reviewed and provided equations of state parameters with a unified pressure metrology for all data.
Focusing on such an equation of state for LiF, which is a unique crystal possessing the largest reported band gap of any material, here we show that a thermodynamical model, termed cBÎ© model, satisfactorily describes the way that the point defect parameters, for various defect processes, are interrelated with bulk properties of the matrix material.
