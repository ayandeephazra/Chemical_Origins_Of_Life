Investigation of elastic properties of nanosized diamond films reveals, that their elastic properties in the range Â± 5% significantly depend on the reconstructions of their surfaces.
Strong correlation between lateral contraction/dilation of the surface and its layer elastic modulus is observed.
In contrast to the recent report of stiffening of nanodiamonds smaller than 2 nm in size, our research suggests more complex influence of crystal morphology on elastic properties of nanodiamonds.
We have found, that in accordance with our previous results for nanofilms with (110) and (100) faces, dilatation of nanofilms with amplitude of up to 5% should be expected and 5% contraction of (111) face.
This results in corresponding change in values of their elastic moduli, compared to those of bulk single crystal diamonds.
