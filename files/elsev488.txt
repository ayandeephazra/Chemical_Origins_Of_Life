As a typical transition metal nitride and promising spintronic material, CrN has many controversial results because of crystallographic nitrogen defects.
One is the bulk softening resulting from electrons transition from localized to itinerated.
Hence, well crystalline CrN synthesized is extremely important to clear the structure behavior under pressure.
Compressed experiments of well crystalline CrN synthesized were measured up to 30.2 GPa in DAC.
Our results show a similar bulk modulus from B1 = 210.7 GPa of Fm-3m phase to B2 = 214.2 GPa of Pnma phase across the whole process of phase transition between 5.3 GPaâ€“8.1 GPa.
The X-ray photoemission spectra indicate no remarkable change of electron transferring between Cr and N and no difference of p-d hybridization across the phase transition.
It is found that the softening of CrN does not take place during the phase transition despite of the change of the d spin correlation.
However, compared to N vacancies that destabilize structure, the nitrogen atoms play a very important role in the magnetic material as magnetic interaction medium ligand atoms and in material elastic properties as well.
This work is significant to further understand high pressure behavior of transition metal nitrides.
