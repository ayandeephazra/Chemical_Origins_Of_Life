MgO is an abundant mineral in the rocky mantle of terrestrial planets, but its melting behaviors remain enigmatic.
Here we introduce a simple theoretical model to investigate the B1-liquid transition of MgO up to 370 GPa.
Vibrational free energies of B1â€“MgO are fully computed by the moment recurrence technique in quantum statistical physics.
On that basis, we associate the melting temperature with the isothermal bulk modulus via the work-heat equivalence principle.
This strategy allows us to quantitatively explain recent experimental data.
Our numerical analyses would yield insights into planetary dynamics and evolution.
