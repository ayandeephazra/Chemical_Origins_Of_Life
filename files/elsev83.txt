Celecoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug for pain and arthritis, is currently only available in capsule form.
To reduce the onset time for a faster action and to lower the manufacturing cost, the tablet dosage form is more preferred.
However, the commercial celecoxib (Form III) is not suitable for direct compression (DC) tablet manufacture due to poor flow, low bulk density, and tablet lamination.
In this work, we overcome these challenges using a pharmaceutically acceptable dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvate of celecoxib.
Aided with the DMSO solvate, an acceptable DC tablet formulation was successfully developed to manufacture tablets containing 200 mg celecoxib, with satisfactory manufacturability, disintegration, and in vitro dissolution performance.
