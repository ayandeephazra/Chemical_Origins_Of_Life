The main objective of this study is to propose an approach to estimate the hyperbolic stress-strain and bulk-modulus model parameters of normally consolidated granular soil mass by using the P- and S-wave velocities.
To this end, the small-strain elastic moduli and their dependence on mean effective pressure are obtained by the seismic velocities based on the equations from theory of elasticity and soil mechanics.
They are then combined with two empirical correlations developed based on the data reported in the literature to determine the model parameters.
To prove the feasibility of this approach, a non-invasive seismic survey including seven surface seismic refraction profiles and an invasive down-hole testing were conducted separately at two different granular sites in Iran, from which the P- and S-wave velocities were derived.
The velocity values were then employed to evaluate the hyperbolic stress-strain and bulk-modulus model parameters based on the proposed approach.
The findings of this study may be used as an appropriate reference for the economic and accurate determination of nonlinear deformation parameters of in-situ granular soil mass using the surface or borehole seismic surveying.
