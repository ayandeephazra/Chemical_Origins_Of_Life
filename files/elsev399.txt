In this study, we prepared a host-guest (H-G) complex containing graphene (Gp) by utilizing the H-G supramolecular force of cyclodextrin (Cd) and azobenzene (Ab).
Then we synthesized a conductive composite (CC) by using Gp-Cd-Ab H-G complex.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of CC confirmed the presence of H-G supramolecular assemblies.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed CC had smaller bulk resistance.
The tensile curves showed CC had larger Youngâ€™s modulus.
CC had the properties of conductive and mechanical self-healing.
CC also showed strain sensing performance.
Thus the composite showed potential application in healable soft sensor.
