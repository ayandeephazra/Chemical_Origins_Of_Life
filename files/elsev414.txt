Dilatometric and shear modulus measurements on four Zr-based glasses both below and above the glass transition temperature upon linear heating and isothermal conditions are performed.
It is found that density changes occurring upon structural relaxation and crystallization are closely related to the relaxation of the shear modulus.
The obtained results are discussed in terms of the Interstitialcy theory.
