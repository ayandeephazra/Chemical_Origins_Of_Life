Bulk modulus (B) is a measure of atomic bond strength, affecting the mechanical behavior of materials, especially for ceramic materials having little plastic deformation.
Tailoring B of ceramic materials can be achieved by element-substitution.
However, such tailoring is more or less based on the trial-and-error approach.
We investigated the correlation between electron work function (EWF) and B of transition metal (TM)-substituted MC carbides through first-principles calculation.
It was shown that TMs with higher EWFs generally resulted in higher bulk modulus, demonstrating that EWF is a promising guiding parameter for selecting effective substitutes.
