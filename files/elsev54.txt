Grape stalks are a lignocellulosic biomass, which is a very complex material, whose easy and profitable fractionation to obtain its basic components is still not available.
Therefore, alternative ways to try and make use of grape stalks are currently being explored.
In the present study, the possible use of dried and milled grape stalks as filler in bio-composites was assessed using polybutylene succinate as a basic polymer.
The tensile specimens produced using 10% grape stalk powder as it is and functionalized through pre-extrusion acetylation and silylation, and silylation in situ were characterized for their structural, mechanical, thermal, morphological, and color properties.
The bio-composites showed to be stiffer than the control polymer, with an increase of Youngâ€™s modulus from 616 MPa to 732 MPa in the specimens obtained with acetylated grape stalk powder.
This led to a potentially new method to valorize by-products of the wine industry such as grape stalks in order to recover raw materials which could prove useful in the biomaterials and bio-composites sector.
