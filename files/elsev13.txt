We present theoretical and experimental results to obtain an intuitive understanding of bulk modulus of metamaterials composed of Helmholtz resonators (HR).
Using transmission line theory, we introduce an intuitive method to determine the frequency domain in which the negative bulk modulus appears.
The results obtained by simulations and experiments are consistent with theoretical results found using transmission line theory.
The results suggest that wider negative (BNG) areas of bulk modulus can be obtained using two HRs than one HR of the same total cavity volume.
