Yttrium hexahydride, YH6 with transition temperature, T c of 224 K in high pressure of 165 GPa is interesting because it has the highest pressure application efficiency.
In this paper, we calculated the discontinuity in the elastic moduli and longitudinal sound velocity at T c of YH6.
The calculated changes at T c in the bulk modulus, Δ B B is 43 ppm, Young’s modulus, Δ Y Y is 46 ppm and longitudinal sound velocity, Δ v L v L is 15 ppm.
These results showed the role of phonons in this hydride superconductor and the values are within the range of most ultrasonic techniques.
The van Hove scenario may be relevant in YH6 due to the large density of states near the Fermi level.
In this paper the electron-phonon coupling constant of YH6 in this scenario was calculated to be λvH = 0.040.
The elastic anomalies at the transition temperature were compared with other type of superconducting materials.
